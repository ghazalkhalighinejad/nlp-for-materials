{"Scanning_Electron_Microscopy": {"EquipmentUsed": "JEOL JSM-6335F", "Description": "The resulting composites were then fractured in liquid      nitrogen and examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6335F)."}, "Electrometry": {"Description": "The electrical resistivity was measured under an applied electrical field of 10 kV/cm over the thickness of the disc specimens with a guard ring to remove any effect of surface conduction. The nonlinearity of the composite was also measured by changing the applied field strength up to approximately 60 kV/cm."}}
