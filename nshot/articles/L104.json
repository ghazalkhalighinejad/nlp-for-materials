"]], ["Main", ["Ferroelectric polymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)) have great potential for applications in micro-electromechanical devices and high-charge storage capacitors.[ 1\u20133] In order to realize these applications, it is highly desirable to substantially improve the dielectric constants of such ferroelectric polymers.[4] Up to now, much work has focused on the preparation of 0\u20133-type composites based on polymers and ceramics of high dielectric constant, and the resultant composites usually possess a relatively high dielectric permittivity (about 100).[5\u20137] Nevertheless, the high volume fraction (>50 vol%) of ceramics, which was necessary to achieve the high dielectric constants, presents a number of limitations, in terms of high weight, low flexibility, and poor mechanical performance, as a result of the weak matrix-filler bonding and agglomeration of ceramic nanoparticles.[8\u201310] Furthermore, most ceramics of high dielectric constant are lead-based, and potentially harmful to our health. To overcome the limitations of ferroelectric polymer/ceramic composites, very promising work has been carried out recently based on percolation theory, in which a small volume fraction of some conductive filler was added to the polymer matrix to achieve a high dielectric constant, thus preserving the mechanical flexibility of the polymer.[4,9,11\u201316] For example, Dang et al.[9] fabricated a new poly(vinylidene fluoride)/carbon-nanotube composite, with a percolation threshold of 8 vol%, possessing a dielectric constant of 600 (the dielectric loss value, tan d, is about 2) at 1000 Hz. For a P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)/carbon-nanotube system, the dielectric constant increased from 57 to 102 (tan\u03b4=0.36) at 100 Hz, by inclusion of only 2 wt% (1.2 vol%) carbon nanotubes.[4] A dielectric constant as high as 56 was observed in a PVDF/acetylene-black composite, when the acetylene-black concentration was in the neighborhood of the percolation threshold (about 1.3 vol%).[13] Recently, Panda et al.[14] reported that, for PVDF/Ni composites, a high effective dielectric constant of 2050 (tan\u03b4=10) at 100 Hz was observed near the percolation threshold of 27 vol%. Along this line, in this communication, we propose a novel nanocomposite system consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride) and exfoliated graphite nanoplates (PVDF/xGnPs). The xGnPs were selected as the conductive filler, because of their good electrical and thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, and more importantly, large aspect ratio and unique layered structure with nanoscale thickness, which give advantages in the formation of a large number of parallel-board microcapacitors with low filler loading.[17\u201321] Moreover, functional groups, such as C\u2013O\u2013C, C\u2013OH, and C=O, existing on the surface of graphite nanoplates, can promote the interaction between the PVDF and the graphite nanoplates, leading to good dispersion of xGnPs in the matrix.[19\u201321] It is well known that the homogenous dispersion of conductive fillers in a polymer matrix is a critical factor in achieving a high-performance nanocomposite.[4,6,9,11] Therefore, it was expected that a much lower volume fraction of xGnP in the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposite could result in a greater increase in dielectric permittivity. xGnPs were obtained from subjecting natural graphite flakes to acidic intercalation, rapid thermal treatment, and ultrasonic powdering, in sequence (see S1 in Supporting Information). Natural graphite flakes (see S2 in Supporting Information), a naturally abundant and low-cost carbon-based material, are composed of parallel carbon layers. Carbon atoms within the graphite layers connect to each other to form six-member rings through strong covalent bonds, while the parallel carbon layers are joined together by weak van der Waals force. Such a structure makes it possible to intercalate some small molecules into the interlayer space of graphite. In the present study, natural graphite flakes were first converted to graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), through intercalation and chemical oxidation in the presence of concentratedH2SO4 and HNO3. When heated at high temperatures, because of the volatilization of the mixed acid, the GICs could be expanded up to a few hundred times along the direction perpendicular to the carbon-layer plane of the intercalated graphite, so that expanded graphite (EG), which is a worm-like material (see the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, shown in Fig. 1a), could be obtained. It is also important to note that some functional groups could be introduced to the graphite during the preparation of the GICs and EG. After ultrasonic treatment, the graphite worms were fragmented into exfoliated graphite nanoplates with diameters of 0.5\u201325mm and thicknesses of 20\u201360nm (see S3 in Supporting Information), as shown by the SEM image in Figure 1b. Elemental analysis of the xGnPs by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX, see S4 in Supporting Information) showed an atomic ratio of carbon to oxygen of about 117:4. Compared with the results reported by Pan et al.,[20] the oxidation degree of graphite in this study was much lower, thus the good conductivity of the graphite was maintained. The oxidation of graphite can be further confirmed by the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the xGnPs in Figure 2. As can be seen, the band at 3433 cm-1 corresponds to the O\u2013H stretching vibration. The presence of carboxyl functional groups is confirmed by the absorption at around 1800\u20131500 cm-1.[19] The multiple bands in the 1400\u20131000 cm-1 region can be attributed to C\u2013O\u2013C and C\u2013H vibrations.[21] A combination of EDAX and FTIR results indicates that, after the acidic intercalation and thermal treatment, some carbon double bonds were oxidized, resulting in the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the exfoliated graphite nanoplates. It is believed that these functional groups facilitate the interaction between the PVDFand xGnPs.[19] PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites were prepared by a solution-cast and hot-press technique. The distribution of graphite nanoplates in the PVDF matrix is largely influenced by their dispersion state in the solvent. The good dispersion stability of the xGnPs in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent and a DMF solution of PVDF is clearly evident from the photographic images (shown as insets a) and b) of Fig. 2), taken two weeks after the ultrasonic dispersion. The good dispersion stability of the xGnPs both in DMF solvent and PVDF solution may be attributed to the functionalization effect on the surfaces of graphite nanoplates. Figure 1c shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a PVDF/xGnP nanocomposite obtained from solution casting. Clearly, the graphite nanoplates were well dispersed in the PVDF matrix without any aggregation, which can be ascribed to specific interactions between the functional groups of the xGnPs and the \u2013CF2\u2013 group of the PVDF. The interaction between the PVDF and xGnPs can also be confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements (see S5 and S6 in Supporting Information). Furthermore, it should be noted that the graphite nanoplates tend to lie down inside the PVDF matrix. As a result, the faces of the xGnPs were parallel to the nanocomposite-film plate. During the hot-press process, several solution-cast films were stacked layer by layer in a \u2018\u2018sandwich\u2019\u2019 form, and then pressed at 200 \u00b0C.[6] This promoted the formation of a larger number of microcapacitors in the nanocomposites. That is, the graphite nanoplates were parallel to each other, isolated by a polymer layer as a medium between the nanoplates, as shown in Figure 1d. We believe that the excellent dispersion of the xGnPs and the existence of many microcapacitors in the PVDF matrix are beneficial in achieving a high dielectric constant, but with low xGnP loading and dielectric loss.[11] The effective alternating-current (AC) conductivity as a function of the xGnP volume fraction at 1000Hz is shown in Figure 3. It shows that the conductivity increases only slightly with the increase in xGnP volume fraction ( fxGnP), when the xGnP volume fraction is low. This is followed by an obvious insulator-to-conductor transition (known as the percolation transition) at fxGnP\u22480.76\u20131.55 vol%. The conductivity of the polymer/conductive-filler composites originates from two mechanisms: 1) Ohmic conduction, through direct contact of conductive fillers, and 2) non-Ohmic conduction, through the barrier-tunnelling effect between the conductive fillers separated by a polymer layer. The percolation transition can be seen as the transition from non-Ohmic conduction to Ohmic conduction, when the filler concentration approaches the percolation threshold. The conductivity \u03c3 of the conductorinsulator composites near the percolation threshold can be predicted by the power laws in Equation 1a and b, as follows:  In Equation 1, fc is the percolation threshold, fxGnP is the volume fraction of xGnP, and \u03c30 and t are the critical exponents in the insulating ( fxGnP<fc) and conducting ( fxGnP>fc) region, respectively. The best fits of the experimental conductivity values to the log\u2013log plots of the power laws give fc=1.01 vol%, t=1.97, and s'=1.30 (see the insets in Fig. 3). The critical exponent in the conducting region, t=1.97, is in agreement with the universal ones (tun\u22481.6\u20132). However, the critical exponent value in the insulating region, s'=1.30, is higher than the universal value (sun\u22480.8\u20131), but close to that of PVDF/ Ni composites.[14,22] A giant increase in the dielectric constant near the percolation threshold can be obtained, as predicted by the percolation theory. As shown in Figure 4, the dielectric constant improved dramatically, and up to more than 200 when fxGnP=1.01 vol%, which is 20 times larger than that of pure PVDF (about 10). As far as the dielectric loss is concerned, an abrupt increase was observed near the percolation threshold (see the bottom right inset of Fig. 4), which is expected due to the formation of conductive paths within the nanocomposites. At fxGnP=1.01 vol%, the dielectric loss was 0.48, which is still acceptable for applications such as high-charge storage capacitors. As fxGnP increased beyond the percolation threshold, the dielectric constant of the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites continued to rise, to an exceptionally high value of about 4.5\u00d7107 at 1000 Hz,[23] although at this point the dielectric loss was also high (229). This high-dielectric-permittivity and high-dielectric-loss nanocomposite is highly beneficial in applications such as electromagnetic-wave absorption. When the xGnP concentration is near the percolation threshold, the dielectric constant (e) can be characterized by the percolation-theory power law in Equation 2, as follows:  In Equation 2, fc=1.01 vol% and s=0.76 (see the top right inset of Fig. 4). Figure 5 shows the conductivity of the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites as a function of frequency with different xGnP loadings. When fxGnP<fc, the conductivity increases almost linearly with the increase of frequency; when fxGnP>fc, the conductivity values are much greater than those for fxGnP<fc, and are almost independent of the change of frequency within a low-frequency range. The percolationthreshold power law is described in Equation 3:  In Equation 3, \u03c9=2\u03c0\u03bd, where \u03bd is the frequency, and u is the corresponding critical exponent. The experimental data for the nanocomposite with fc=1.01 vol% give u=1.10, which is larger than the calculated value: u = t/(s+t) = 1.97/(0.76+1.79) = 0.72.[24] A similar result has been reported in polyimide/silver composites.[25] Figure 6 shows the dielectric permittivity of the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites as a function of frequency with different xGnP loadings. As can be seen, when fxGnP<fc, the dielectric constant decreases very slowly with the increase of frequency; when fxGnP\u2265fc, the dielectric constant reduces sharply in the low-frequency range, followed by a gradual decrease in the high-frequency range. The dielectric properties of the novel PVDF/ xGnP nanocomposites are compared with those of PVDF/conductive-filler composites reported in the literatures (see S7 in Supporting Information). As can be seen, 1) A low percolation threshold is important in maintaining the mechanical flexibility of PVDF. The percolation threshold of PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites, fc=1.01 vol%, is much lower than the lowest percolation threshold of PVDF/ conductive-filler composites reported previously. Our experimental findings agree well with the recent theoretical prediction by Xie et al.,[26] who predicted that planar conductive fillers with extremely high aspect ratios can significantly enhance the conductivity and dielectric constant of composites at a very small percolation transition. 2) In the percolative stage ( fxGnP=fc=1.01 vol%), the dielectric constant of PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites at 100 Hz is near 2700, which is significantly higher than that of the PVDF/ conductive-filler composites previously reported, and is three times that of a poly(vinylidene fluoride)/carbon-nanotubes composite ( fMWNT=fc=8 vol%).[9] The significant increment in dielectric constant of PVDF/ xGnP nanocomposites can be mainly attributed to the homogenous dispersion of xGnPs in the PVDF polymer matrix and a gradual formation of the microcapacitor networks in the PVDF/ xGnP nanocomposites as the xGnP content increases.[9,12] The evolution process of the dielectric constant in PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites with the change of xGnP content can be divided into three stages (I, II, and III). Initially, as shown in part I of Figure 4, when a small amount of xGnPs is incorporated into the PVDF matrix, some microcapacitance structures are formed, resulting in a slight increase of dielectric constant relative to that of pure PVDF. As the xGnP content is further increased, the dielectric constant gradually rises. Up to the percolation threshold (see part II of Figure 4), there are many conductive graphite nanoplates isolated by very thin dielectric insulating-polymer layers within the nanocomposites, forming lots of microcapacitors, which leads to a very high dielectric constant. Then, beyond the percolation threshold, the dielectric constant of the PVDF/ xGnPs keeps on rising, because the graphite nanoplates are still wrapped by a thin layer of polymer matrix, if they are well dispersed. As the xGnP content increases to 3.12 vol%, the dielectric constant decreases (see part III of Figure 4), due to the formation of a significant conductive network, and the resultant leakage current within the nanocomposite.[15] In addition, Maxwell\u2013Wagner\u2013Sillars (MWS) polarization for heterogeneous systems also plays a very important role in improving the dielectric constant.[9] The MWS effect, which is associated with the entrapment of free charges between the insulator/conductor interfaces, can be characterized by the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant in the lowfrequency range. For the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites, the dielectric constant is almost independent of frequency when fxGnP<fc, indicating that there is no plentiful accumulation of interfacial charges inside the nanocomposites. As soon as the percolation process takes place, a sudden increase in dielectric constant at low frequencies can be observed. This means that there were many xGnPs separated by very thin dielectric PVDF layers. Thus, a lot of charges were blocked at the interfaces between the filler and polymer matrix, owing to the MWS effect, which makes a remarkable contribution to the increment of the dielectric permittivity in the low-frequency range. However, when the frequency was over 105 Hz, the dielectric permittivity of the composites was dominated by the microcapacitance-structure model (frequency-independent), so that it is maintained at a stable value of about 100, which is still much larger than that of pure PVDF. In conclusion, a novel PVDF/xGnP nanocomposite was successfully fabricated by a solution-cast and hot-press method. It was found that the homogenous dispersion of xGnPs in the PVDF matrix could significantly improve the dielectric constant of a PVDF/xGnP nanocomposite with an extremely low percolation threshold. A high dielectric constant of more than 200 and 2700 could be obtained for the PVDF/xGnP nanocomposite near the percolation threshold (1.01 vol%) at 1000 and 100 Hz, respectively, which is 20 and 270 times higher than that of a PVDF matrix. When above the percolation threshold, the dielectric constant continued to increase, and the maximum value was as high as 4.5 \u00d7 107, with a high dielectric loss of 229 at 1000 Hz (2.34 vol%). The giant increment in the dielectric permittivity can be explained by the combination of the microcapacitance-structure model and the MWS effect. These flexible PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites with such high dielectric performance are potential materials for practical applications in high-charge storage capacitors and electromagnetic-wave absorption.
