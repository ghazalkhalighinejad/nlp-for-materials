The mass of 0.1 g of rutile was dispersed in 100 mL of\n10 mol/L aqueous NaOH solution, and the suspension was stirred in\na closed PTFE vessel at 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. After cooling to room\ntemperature, the suspension of TiNT was first washed with distilled\nwater until pH \u2248 10 was reached and then further reduced by\naddition of concentrated HCl until pH \u2248 6 was achieved. To remove\nthe salts, the suspension was ultrafiltered in a stirred cell (Millipore)\nwith a membrane MW cutoff of 50000. The prepared suspension of\nTiNT at a concentration of 1 g/L was either used directly in further\nfunctionalization step or freeze-dried to isolate the pristine TiNT.\nEpoxy resin based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A\n(Epikote 828, epoxy equivalent = 187 g/equiv, Hexion), further\ndenoted as DGEBA, was first heated at 60 \u00b0C for 2 h to melt any\ncrystalline structures. After cooling, pristine or functionalized TiNT\nwere dispersed in DGEBA using a high-speed mixer (Turbotest 33/\n300P, Rayneri) at 2000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Then, a\nstoichiometric amount of polyoxypropylene diamine hardener (Jeffamine\nD 2000, amine equivalent = 492 g/equiv, Huntsman), further\ndenoted as D2000, was added and quickly degassed while stirring\nunder vacuum. The prepared reactive dispersions were either kept in a\nfreezer at \u221220 \u00b0C (for kinetics measurements) or cured in a silicone\nmold at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h followed by postcuring for 2 h at 150 \u00b0C. The\nfinal nanocomposites always contained 3 wt % of pristine or modified\nTiNT. The neat DGEBA-D2000 epoxy matrix was prepared following\nthe same protocol without TiNT addition.",
