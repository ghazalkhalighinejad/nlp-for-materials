            "ExperimentalProcedure": "(P2VP) was received from Polymer Source or Scientific Polymer\nProducts and used as received. All polymer molar mass moments and\ndistributions were verified by gel permeation chromatography\n(GPC) relative to narrow polystyrene standards, and all dispersities\nwere <1.3, as listed in Table S1. Partially deuterated poly(2-\nvinylpyridine) (dP2VP) was synthesized at the Center for Nanophase\nMaterials Science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The deuterium-\nto-hydrogen ratio (measured by elastic recoil detection) is\napproximately 1:2, and the weight-averaged molecular weight and\ndispersity (measured by GPC) are 100 kg/mol and 1.2, respectively.\nDry octa(aminophenyl) polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (OAPS)\npowder was used as received.\nPNCs were fabricated by solution mixing and drying. Solutions of\nMaterials and PNC Preparation. All poly(2-vinylpyridine)\nOAPS in MeOH (cOAPS \u223c 20 g/L) and P2VP in MeOH (cP2VP \u223c 50\ng/L) were fabricated and allowed to stir for several hours. Once\ncompletely dissolved, the requisite amount of OAPS/MeOH was\nadded dropwise to P2VP/MeOH solutions while stirring. P2VP/\nOAPS/MeOH solutions were stirred for at least 24 h before\ndeposition and annealing, as further described below.",
