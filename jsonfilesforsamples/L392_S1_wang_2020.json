Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent for\nthe surface modification of nano-Al(OH)3.\" \"Surface modification was performed by a solution mixing\nmethod. First, nano-Al(OH)3 was dispersed in acetone, and\nthen the coupling agent having a mass ratio of 1.5% to the\nnanoparticles was added to the mixed solution. The ultrasonic\ncell disruptor was used to prevent the agglomeration of\nnanoparticles and provided a reaction temperature. After that,\nthe mixture was centrifuged for solid-liquid separation. Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent for\nthe surface modification of nano-Al(OH)3.\" The acetone was removed and the nanoparticles separated were heated in the oven for 24 h and grinded. A torque rheometer was used to disperse the nanoparticles into the polyethylene pellets homogeneously at 120 o C, for this temperature is higher than the melting temperature and lower than the reaction temperature of dicumyl peroxide. Then thin film samples were prepared by hot pressing and this process was held at 140 o C for 20 min with a pressure of 10 MPa to ensure the fully crosslinking process. Before the measurements, samples were degassed at 70 o C for 24 h to exclude crosslinking by-products effectively.",

First, the oil was heated to the test temperatures and then the samples were placed between the electrodes for 5 min before the test. The test temperatures were 20, 50, 70 and 90 o C. Each kind of samples has been tested 20 times. All the data presented here were acquired at a ramp rate of 3 kV/s.
