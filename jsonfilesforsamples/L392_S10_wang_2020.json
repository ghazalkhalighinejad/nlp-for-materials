The top electrode was a semiconducting electrode and the bottom electrode was aluminum. An electric pulse with a duration of 10 ns and an amplitude of 400 V was applied to the sample to stimulate the space charge and to generate the acoustic signal. Silicone oil was used as acoustic coupling. The space charge curves were obtained under 40 kV/mm within 5 min."
