A high potential was applied to the spherical electrode with a diameter of 1/4 inch (0.64 cm). The plane electrode was grounded. All the tests were performed at room temperature (30 \u25e6C) using a stepwise-voltage method. Each voltage step was 100 V and was maintained for approximate 1 s before the high-voltage electrode was grounded and the next higher voltage was applied."
