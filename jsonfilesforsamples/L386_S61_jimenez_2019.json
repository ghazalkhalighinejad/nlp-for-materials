For the composites, the NPs were then added via a micropipet and stirred for another hour at 60 \u00b0C. The samples were then probe sonicated for 3 min (looping 2 s on, 1 s off to minimize bond breaking) and cast in a Teflon dish at 60 \u00b0C in an oven at \u22125 in.Hg for 1 h to facilitate a mild evaporation process. The samples were then left in the vacuum oven for 1 day at room temperature and 1 day at 80 \u00b0C to remove any remaining solvent and to thermally anneal the polymer. A hot press was used at 80 \u00b0C to mold the samples into disks.",
