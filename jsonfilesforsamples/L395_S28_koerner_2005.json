This mixture is then added to a polymer solution in the same solvent, stirred for an additional 2\u20134 h, and transferred into casting molds to allow slow solvent evaporation. The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 8C until a constant weight was achieved."

Sample to detector distance was 164 mm and the wavelength was 0.1366 nm, defined by a double multi-layer monochromator. The synchrotron X-rays were collimated to a 600 \u03bcm beam size using a three-pinhole collimator [17]. 40\u00d74\u00d70.5 mm3 samples were mounted in a uniaxial, symmetrical extension device designed to expose the gauge section of the sample to the X-ray beam at arbitrary elongations."
