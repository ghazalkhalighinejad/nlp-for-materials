            "ExperimentalProcedure": "First of all, 6 ml of PS emulsion (0.1 g/ml), 1.8 ml of deionized water and 7.2 ml of GO dispersion (5 mg/ml) were added to a 50 ml three-necked flask, the mixture was then sonicated and stirred for 30 min. The obtained PS/GO suspensions was vacuum filtered by batch type at a rate of 1 mL/time. The filter cake obtained by vacuum filtration was placed in a Petri dish, and 10 mL of acetic acid (HAc) and 3.6 mL of HI acid were added thereto.\nFurthermore, the Petri dish was sealed with a plastic wrap and placed in an oven for 40 h at 40 \u00b0C. At last, the reduced PS/rGO complex was washed several times with ethanol and dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C. The dried filter cake was placed in a mold and molded under a pressure of 3000 MPa for 2 min, and then the compacted wafer was heated at 130 \u00b0C for 3 h to obtain a PS/rGO composite",
