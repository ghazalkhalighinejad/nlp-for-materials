['The preparation of the xGnPs was described in the main text. PVDF/ xGnP nanocomposites were prepared as follows: a desired amount of xGnPs was first ultrasonically dispersed in 200mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 1 h. Then, PVDF was added into the xGnP suspension. After stirring for 30 min at 80 °C, and ultrasonicating for another 2 h, the mixture was poured onto a glass plate to form a thin film, and dried at 70 °C for 3 days. Samples for testing were made by hot-pressing several solution-cast films stacked together at 200 °C, as described by Arbatti et al. [6]. The dielectric properties of the samples were measured using an Agilent 4294 A impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 50–107 Hz at room temperature. SEM (JEOL Model, JSM-6490) and TEM (JEOL Model, JEM-2010) were employed to observe the microscopic structures of the xGnPs and PVDF/xGnP nanocomposites.']
