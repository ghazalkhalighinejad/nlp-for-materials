['Recently, the potential of using inorganic minerals as fillers in polymeric composites has become appreciated in areas of commercial and scientific application, and many investigations have been published [BIB1 BIB2 BIB3 BIB4 BIB5 BIB6 BIB7]. The mechanical and thermal properties of inorganic/organic nanocomposites are expected to be considerably improved when the largest possible inorganic surface area is presented to the matrix. To achieve this improvement, the fillers must be fully dispersed throughout, and connected to the matrix using an appropriately modified intermediary to increase the hydrophobicity of the inorganic composites [BIB8]. Silica particles, however, are difficult to disperse in organic solvent without surfactant because they tend to form large aggregations.', 'This work concerns the problem of silica particle dispersion and demonstrates a route to prevent the aggregation of silica by modifying silica surface. These modified silica particles disperse well among various monomers to form inorganic/polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, organically modified silica makes inorganic components more hydrophobic, causing them to disperse effectively throughout organic solvent or polymer matrices. Therefore, inorganic/organic nanocomposites without aggregated inorganic components in the polymer phases are obtained. Briefly, the organic modification of inorganic components is the most important process prior to the preparation of inorganic/polymer nanocomposites.', 'This study examines the bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). AEROSIL® R805, R812 and R972 were used as the three modified silicas, which were treated with amorphous silica, as indicated in [FIG1]\n                     . Numerous inorganic/PMMA nanocomposites have recently been investigated [BIB9 BIB10 BIB11 BIB12 BIB13 BIB14 BIB15], and found to exhibit some properties superior to those of pure PMMA. Silicas are commercially available and the effects between a modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix have been studied to improve their utility, related to mechanical properties, hardness and surface abrasion.', 'Reliable kinetic parameters for the thermal degradation of silica/PMMA nanocomposites are determined. Even if the degradation has been extensively studied [BIB16 BIB17 BIB18 BIB19 BIB20 BIB21 BIB22 BIB23 BIB24], there are lots of investigations for the thermal degradation of inorganic/PMMA composites. Most researchers have examined layered silicate composites or the use of in situ sol–gel processes to improve interactions to prepare silica/PMMA nanocomposites. The relationships between the properties of the polymer and the content of modifying silica are interesting. This paper describes a simple approach that involves adding modified silica to MMA solution to generate the silica/PMMA composites, and considers the relationships between the modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix, and mechanical and thermal behaviors.']
