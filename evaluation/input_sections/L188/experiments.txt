[['Materials', ['Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was distillated twice before being used. Three species of modified silica particles, AEROSIL® R805, R812 and R972, were used as received. [FIG2] \n                        indicates that methyl (–CH3) and ethylene (–CH2–) groups (2862cm−1–2963cm−1) are present in the modified silica, but –OH groups (3421cm−1) are present in the unmodified silica. FT-IR confirmed the presence of organics in the modified silica product and confirmed the integrity of the organic molecules. 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) from Fluka was recrystallized twice from methanol before it was used as a radical initiator.']], ['Preparation of silica/PMMA composites', ['Before the silica/PMMA nanocomposites were prepared, the silica powder was well dispersed throughout the MMA monomer under sonification to yield various concentrations of silica/MMA solution. The different concentrations of silica/MMA solution (100g) with 0.7g AIBN were placed in a 200ml beaker. This mixture was stirred at room temperature under flowing nitrogen, and then was warmed to 80°C for 30min for polymerization; it was cooled to room temperature to cast using 3mm PVC packing. Finally, the mixture was polymerized at 55°C for another 12h in a water bath, and cured at 110°C for an hour.']], ['Characterization and measurement', ['Infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR, was conducted using a BIO-RAD FTS-40A+UMA500 spectrometer with KBr pellet at 4cm−1 resolution. A dynamic mechanical analysis of the composites was performed using a Du-Pont 2980 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The microstructures of the silica/PMMA nanocomposites were characterized using a Hitachi 4500 SEM at an acceleration voltage of 5KV. Thermogravimetry (TGA) was performed using a TA TGA-Q50 thermobalance. Samples of approximately 10–15mg were heated at various heating rates under nitrogen purge (70ml/min). Isothermal TGA was carried out by heating the sample to 220°C for 2h under nitrogen purge.']]]
