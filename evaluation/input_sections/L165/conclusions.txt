['PP composites with CaCO3 nanoparticles (∼44nm) were prepared. The notched fracture toughness of the nanocomposites under either quasi-static or impact loading conditions was found substantially higher than that of the pure PP. The TEM study showed that the nanoparticles were distributed in the PP matrix uniformly and little particle agglomeration was found at 4.8 and 9.2vol%. Thermal analysis and SEM studies on the PP and nanocomposites revealed that the CaCO3 nanoparticles are an effective nucleating agent that causes the absence of detectable spherulites. Fractography of the broken specimens from the <i>J</i>-integral tests suggested that the nanoparticles introduce a massive number of stress concentration sites in the matrix and promote cavitation at the particle–matrix boundary when loaded. The cavities, in turn, release the plastic constraint and trigger large-scale plastic deformation of the matrix, which consumes tremendous fracture energy.']
