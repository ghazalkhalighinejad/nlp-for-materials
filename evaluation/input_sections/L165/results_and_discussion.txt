[['Results of nanoparticle characterisation', ['The results of the nanoparticle characterisation are summarised in [TBL2]\n                        . Based on the results of elemental analysis, it can be concluded that the sample contains more than 98wt% CaCO3 with a small amount of impurities including MgO, Fe2O3 and Al2O3. To use these nanoparticles as filler for thermoplastics, it is important to determine their thermal stability. [FIG1] \n                        shows the weight loss of the sample as a function of temperature. The weight loss is minimum, until the temperature is above 400°C. At 550°C, the weight loss is about 5wt%. These results indicate that these CaCO3 nanoparticles can be used as filler for many thermoplastics, because most processing temperatures are below 400°C. The TEM micrograph of the CaCO3 nanoparticles, as shown in [FIG2]\n                        , reveals that the nanoparticles have a high structure and rough surface. Many aggregates can be seen. These results agree with the measured high surface area of 28m2/g for these nanoparticles. Because of the aggregate nature of these nanoparticles, it is difficult to determine the primary particle size precisely. The primary particle size was determined by measuring the sizes of 10 randomly chosen particles. An average particle size of about 44nm was obtained.', 'Calcium carbonate has been used as an important filler in plastic materials. The mechanical properties of the plastic materials can be enhanced significantly, when the filler is surface-modified with an organic material, such as stearic acid or titanate coupling agent. This will improve the compatibility between the filler and polymer. The CCR used in this study were surface-modified by coating with an organic layer, which functions to strengthen the interaction between the inorganic filler and the polymer. This organic layer consists of mostly stearic acid. In general, such a surface organic coating is very thin and cannot be detected easily by conventional techniques. XPS, which is also known as electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), is probably the most widely used technique in the surface characterisation of polymers and other materials. The sampling depth of XPS is approximately 3–5nm [BIB20].', '[FIG3] \n                        shows the XPS spectra of the three major elements on the surface, including carbon, oxygen and calcium. The carbon C1s spectrum has one low binding energy peak at 285eV, representing the carbon of a hydrocarbon and a high binding energy peak at about 290eV, representing the carbon associated with carbonate. The concentration of these two different types of carbon can be calculated using the areas under these two peaks. A higher organic carbon concentration on the surface indicates a higher surface coverage of the organic coating or thicker coating ([TBL3]).']], ['Dispersion of nanoparticles', ['It is known that the dispersion of a filler in the polymer matrix can have a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the composites. The dispersion of an inorganic filler in a thermoplastic is not an easy process. The problem is even more severe, when using nanoparticles as a filler, because the nanoparticles have a strong tendency to agglomerate. Consequently, homogeneous dispersion of the nanoparticles in the thermoplastic matrix is a difficult process. A good dispersion can be achieved by surface modification of the filler particles and appropriate processing conditions. [FIG4 FIG5 FIG6] \n                        \n                        \n                        show the TEM micrographs of the nanocomposites containing 4.8, 9.2 and 13.2vol% CaCO3. These nanocomposites were prepared with a mixing time of 30min. For the nanocomposite with 4.8 and 9.2vol% CaCO3, a good dispersion is achieved. Most CaCO3 aggregates are broken down to primary particles. This should maximise the interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and the polymer. However, more aggregates are found for the nanocomposite with a high concentration of CaCO3 (13.2vol%). This is reasonable considering that at high CaCO3 concentrations, the interparticle distance is small, hence flocculation of these nanoparticles can occur after the mixing is stopped. To determine the optimal mixing time, three mixing times—15, 30 and 45min—were used. The mechanical properties, which can be significantly affected by the dispersion of the nanoparticles in the composites, were measured. [FIG7] \n                        shows the impact strength of the composites prepared with different mixing times. The results suggest that the impact strength is not significantly affected by mixing time. The other mechanical properties of the nanocomposites are also found not being affected by the mixing time, as shown in [TBL4]\n                        . These results indicate that a mixing time of 15 or 30min is adequate.']], ['Effects of nanoparticles on the crystallisation of PP', ['The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites can be significantly changed if the crystallisation characteristics of PP have been altered. [FIG8 FIG9] \n                        \n                        show the DSC curves for the pure PP and the nanocomposites with 4.8, 9.2 and 13.2vol% CaCO3. The DSC results indicate the presence of a small amount of β phase PP after the addition of the CCR. [TBL5] \n                        gives a summary of the crystallisation and melting data of the PP and nanocomposites. The addition of CaCO3 nanoparticles, in general, does not change the crystallinity. In addition, the crystallising temperature of PP is increased by approximately 10°C, when CaCO3 is added to the PP. A recent study [BIB9] has shown that the addition of the untreated and polymer-grafted nanoparticles of SiO2 (particle size of 7nm) does not have any significant effect on the crystallinity and the crystallisation temperature of PP. However, our results show that an increase of 10°C in the crystallisation temperature is achieved, implying that the CaCO3 nanoparticles are a very effective nucleating agent. Khare et al. have shown that the incorporation of CaCO3 with a particle size of about 6μm reduced the crystallisation half-time significantly and the ultimate spherulite size also decreased considerably [BIB21]. They also found that the size of the spherulites decreased as function of the CaCO3 content, until the CaCO3 content reached 10–15wt%. In our case, when these CaCO3 nanoparticles are dispersed in the PP matrix, the number of these nanoparticles is very large even at the filler content of 4.8vol%. If some of these nanoparticles become the nucleating sites, then the number of spherulites will increase dramatically and the size of the spherulites will reduce significantly. The reduction in the spherulite size is very likely to be more severe as the particle size of the filler is reduced dramatically. [FIG10] \n                        shows SEM micrographs of the PP and PP with 9.2vol% CaCO3. The size of spherulites of the PP is large than 40μm, as shown in [FIG10]. However, no spherulitic structure can be seen in the SEM micrograph, as shown in [FIG10], upon the addition of the CaCO3 nanoparticles. It is possible that the spherulites are too small to be detected in this SEM micrograph. The change in crystalline morphology should have a significant effect on the impact and other mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. This effect will be discussed latter.']], ['Tensile properties of the nanocomposites', ['The tensile stress–strain curves of the pure PP and the nanocomposites are shown in [FIG11]\n                        .

[FD1] is appropriate, when strong adhesion exist between the filler and polymer and the filler has a large aspect ratio and [FD2] is applicable to rigid spherical particles [BIB19].', 'Comparing the experimental and calculated modulus, as shown in [FIG12]\n                        , it is obvious that the moduli of the composites lie between the values calculated by [FD1 FD2]. From the SEM results, we know that the spherulitic structure is destroyed, because of the nucleating effect of the CaCO3 nanoparticles. Previous results [BIB22 BIB23] have indicated that a decrease in the spherulite size and crystallinity decreases the modulus of PP, because large spherulites are believed to have a much higher load-bearing capability. The TEM results indicate that the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles is low. Hence, the significantly increase in the modulus must be caused by the strong interaction between the polymer and filler, because of the large interfacial area between them. We believe that there are two-counter balance forces that are affecting the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites—the reinforcing and nucleating effects of the CaCO3 nanoparticles. In addition, the strong interaction between the filler and the polymer increases the tensile strength, as well as yield strength and decreases the ultimate strain. However, the strong nucleating effect of the CaCO3 nanoparticles produces the opposite effects. A reduction in the size of the spherulites generally reduces the yield and ultimate tensile strengths, but increases the ultimate elongation. In addition, the dispersion of the nanoparticles will have a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The dispersion is found to be better for nanocomposites containing 4.8 and 9.2vol% CaCO3 nanoparticles. At filler content of 13.2vol%, many aggregates of nanoparticles are found. This may also accounts for the superior mechanical properties of the nanocomposites containing the lower vol% of filler. In summary, we have a significant increase in the modulus and minor changes in the yield strength, yield strain, ultimate tensile strength and ultimate tensile strain, due to the balance between the reinforcing effect and nucleating effect of the CaCO3 nanoparticles. In addition, the <i>J</i>-integral and impact strength of the nanocomposites have shown dramatic improvement as discussed in [SEC12].']], ['\n                        J-Integral and impact strength of the nanocomposites', ['The fracture behaviour of the PP/CaCO3 nanocomposites was determined using the rigorous <i>J</i>-integral analysis. The results of our <i>J</i>-integral tests are displayed in [FIG13 FIG14 FIG15]\n                        \n                        \n                        . The mode-I critical <i>J</i>-integral (<i>J</i>\n                        IC) values for the three nanocomposites can be read from the figures without any ambiguity; they are 2.5kJ/m2 for the pure PP, as well as 12.6 and 11.3kJ/m2 for the composites with 4.8 and 9.2vol% CaCO3 nanoparticles, respectively. In other words, we found that the addition of a small amount of CaCO3 nanoparticles (4.8vol%) has resulted in a significant 500% increase in the notched fracture toughness.', 'The experimental procedure for the determination of the critical <i>J</i>-integral is based on the original suggestion given by Begley and Landes [BIB24]. The physical meaning of this procedure is schematically illustrated in [FIG16]\n                        . Obviously, the <i>J</i>\n                        IC gives the critical <i>J</i>-integral value, above which a new crack at the blunted crack tip will initiate. Thus, it represents the crack initiation toughness of the tested piece. This toughness is closely related to the energy-dissipating events occurring in the region immediately ahead of the crack tip (the shadow region in [FIG16]) before the crack onset. For the particulate-filled semi-crystalline polymers, crazing, shear banding, filler-induced cavitation and the cavitation-trigged-matrix shearing have been identified as the major energy-dissipating mechanisms.', "It is also well accepted that whether these energy-dissipating events can happen in the specimen is determined, to a large extend, by the morphology of the semi-crystalline polymers. One of these morphological parameters is the crystal structure of the polymer, such as crystallinity and spherulite size. In a previous work by Friedrich [BIB25], the effects of morphology on the formation and development of craze, as well as the influence of the crazing process on the mechanical and fracture properties of polymers were elaborated. Strong evidence given by the author showed that the semi-crystalline polymer with small spherulites tends to be tougher than the one with coarse spherulites, because larger spherulites have weaker boundaries. In another work, Ouederni and Philips [BIB26] studied the effect of crystal structure on the <i>J</i>\n                        IC of PP samples with different crystallinities or spherulite sizes, but the same crystallinity. The authors found that an increase in crystallinity or spherulite size could decrease the toughness, which is in agreement with the Friedrich's conclusions. However, the same authors [BIB26] also found that for a given crystallinity, the spherulite size reduction through use of a nucleating agent did not benefit the toughness of PP. The authors believed that use of a nucleating agent would result in thicker lamellae and thinner interlamellar amorphous layers, which are detrimental to the fracture toughness of the PP. Hence, they argued that the strong influence of spherulite size was not originated from the boundary of the spherulite; rather, it is a reflection of the spherulitic structure. Regardless of the discrepancy of the mechanisms offered by these two research teams, convincing experimental evidence from both teams demonstrated that small spherulites and low crystallinity would lead to higher fracture toughness.", 'Cavitation and cavitation-induced massive shear deformation have been identified as a dominant toughening mechanism in the rubber toughened thermoset and thermoplastic polymer blends. In a recent work [BIB27 BIB28 BIB29 BIB30], the cavitation/shear deformation was also found to be the control toughening mechanism in some rigid–rigid polymer blends. The key point of this toughening mechanism is that the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip is under the plane-strain condition; therefore, the materials are subjected to high plastic constraint. Without a constraint-releasing mechanism, the material under this tri-axial tension tends to fracture in the brittle mode with low toughness. In rubber-toughened polymer blends, because of the low tear strength of the rubber particles, cavitation of the rubber particle happens under the tri-axial tension and it releases the high plastic constraint and enables large-scale plastic deformation in the ligament between the two cavities. In the rigid–rigid polymer blends, cavitation at the boundary of the two rigid phases was found to have the same function as that of rubber particle cavitation [BIB31 BIB32 BIB33 BIB34].', 'In the light of above discussion, it is reasonable to propose that the absence of the spherulites ([TBL5]) must have a positive effect on the <i>J</i>\n                        IC of the nanocomposites, although it is not clear to us whether it can be caused by other mechanisms. On the other hand, we did find that the massive plastic deformation on the fracture surface of the nanocomposites was accompanied by a large number of voids, which was clearly caused by matrix cavitation due to the addition of the nanoparticles. As demonstrated by the SEM micrographs in [FIG17]\n                        , the fracture surface of the nanocomposite with 4.8vol% CaCO3 has a highly plastically deformed zone filled with sub-micron voids. Some of these voids have particles standing inside the cavities. The matrix ligaments between these voids are stretched and deformed extensively. Similar characteristics are also found in the nanocomposite with 9.2vol% filler ([FIG17]). The fracture surface of the pure PP is, however, smooth and featureless ([FIG17]). Based on this microscopic observation, we believe that the cavitation-induced shear deformation is most probably the dominant energy-dissipating event responsible for the very high <i>J</i>\n                        IC of the nanocomposites. Firstly, the CaCO3 nanoparticles, which serve as a nucleating agent change the morphological structure of the PP matrix. Secondly, the nanoparticles act as stress concentrators and promote cavitation at the particle–polymer boundaries. Our previous TEM results [BIB35] on carbon black-filled PP (10wt% carbon black in PP) indicate that the amorphous regions of PP are sandwiched between the crystalline lamellae. The thickness of individual amorphous layer is a few nanometers. The carbon black particles or aggregates are dispersed inside the spherulites and there is a thin layer of amorphous PP encapsulating the carbon black particles and aggregates. It is quite possible that the CaCO3-filled PP has a morphological structure similar to that of the carbon black-filled PP. Based on this proposed morphological structure, numerous cavitation sites will be created at the interface between the CaCO3 particles and the amorphous layers. The cavities formed will release the plastic constraint in the matrix and trigger large-scale plastic deformation, leading to much improved fracture toughness.', 'As fracture toughness of polymer materials depends very much on the mobility (relaxation time) of the polymer chains under the testing condition, thus, both temperature and deformation rate have great influences on the fracture behaviour. It is not uncommon that a material showing high quasi-static fracture toughness has poor impact strength. A good example is polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), which is highly strain rate sensitive [BIB34]. In many cases, the strain-rate embrittlement is due to that the toughening mechanisms that readily occur in the quasi-static loading condition are suppressed by the high strain rate in the impact test.', 'However, this is not the case in the present study. As demonstrated in [FIG7], the impact strength of the PP nanocomposites (mixing time=30min) increases with the filler content reaching a peak value of about 128J/m at the filler content of 9.2vol%. Compared with the pure PP (55.2J/m), the improvement in impact strength owing to the addition of the nanoparticles is about 2.5 times. This represents a substantial improvement. Although the exact micromechanical deformation mechanisms in impact are still under investigation and not very clear to us at the time of writing this paper, it is reasonable to believe that the toughening mechanism proposed for the quasi-static fracture, namely, the cavitation-induced massive shear deformation, is plausibly the main mechanism.']]]
