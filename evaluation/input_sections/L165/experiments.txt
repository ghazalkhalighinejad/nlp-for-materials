[['Materials', ['PP homopolymer (PD 403, melt index=1.5g at 230°C and 2.16kg) with density 1.04kg/l was provided by Montell, USA. The calcium carbonate nanoparticles (CCR) were obtained from Guang Ping Nano Technology Group Ltd, Hong Kong, and the anti-oxidant was Irganox 1010.']], ['Characterisation of calcium carbonate', ['The concentration of Ca, Mg, Fe, Al and Si in the CaCO3 nanoparticles was determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Optima 3000 ICP). The amount of carbon and hydrogen in the sample was determined by a carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen analyser. The water content of the nanoparticles was measured using a thermogravimetric analyser (TA TGA 2950). The surface area of the CaCO3 nanoparticles was measured by nitrogen adsorption method (BET) using a surface area analyser (Beckman SA 3100). The particle sizes of the nanoparticles were determined by a JEOL JEM-100 CX II transmission electron microscope (TEM). To prepare the nanoparticle sample for TEM examination, the CaCO3 nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10min. The average size of the primary particles was determined by measuring the sizes of the 10 randomly chosen particles. The surface chemical composition of the CaCO3 nanoparticles was determined using a PHI 5600 multi-technique system equipped with an Al monochromatic X-ray source.']], ['Preparation of the nanocomposites', ['Before mixing, PP and CaCO3 nanoparticles were dried in an oven at 120°C for 1h and then cooled down to room temperature. The materials were stored in a desiccator prior to processing. Blending was carried out in a Haake mixer. The mixing temperature was 180°C and the rotor speed was 60rpm. The PP and anti-oxidant were mixed for 1min before the CaCO3 was added slowly over a period of 10min. When all the materials were added into the mixing chamber, the materials were further mixed for a fixed period of time. After mixing, the compound was cut into small pieces.', 'A vertical injection-moulding machine (Morgan Press) was used for preparing the samples for mechanical tests. The operating conditions are shown in [TBL1]\n                        . Tensile (ASTM-D638, type IV) and impact bars (ASTM-D256) of pure PP and the nanocomposites were prepared. Prior to the mechanical testing, both the tensile and impact bars were conditioned at the temperature of 23±2°C and the relative humidity of 50±5% for 40h.']], ['Characterisation of the nanocomposites', ['The crystallinity of the nanocomposites was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (TA 2910). The temperature of the instrument was calibrated with indium and the baseline was checked using sapphire. All tests were performed in nitrogen atmosphere with a sample weight about 8–10mg. For each test, the sample was first heated to 200°C at 20°C/min and then annealed for 5min to destroy any residual nuclei and to ensure an identical thermal history. The specimen was subsequently cooled down to room temperature at a cooling rate of 5°C/min for data collection.', 'The size of the PP spherulites was studied using a JEOL JSM-6300 scanning electron microscope. Strips were cut from the compression-moulded PP and PP nanocomposites. The samples were trimmed with a Leica Ultracut R microtome at about −100°C to produce a smooth surface for permanganic etching. The etchant was composed of 0.5wt% potassium permanganate in a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid in a 3:2 volumetric ratio. The ultrathin sections (∼70nm thick) of the PP nanocomposites were mounted on 200-mesh copper grids and dried in a desiccator for more than 24h before the TEM examination. The TEM examination of the ultrathin section was conducted on a JOEL 100CX II TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 80kV.', 'The tensile experiment was performed with a tensile tester (Instron 5567) at a crosshead speed of 5mm/min. Before the tensile testing, the width and the thickness of the specimens were measured with a micrometer. The tensile modulus of the samples was determined at 0.5% strain and the tensile strength at yield was determined according to ASTM-D638. Five specimens of each sample were tested and the mean values and standard deviations were calculated.', 'The impact test was performed following the ASTM-D256 method. Notching was done on a CSI Automatic notcher (CS-93M). The table feed rate and the cutter speed were 100mm/min and 92m/min, respectively. Prior to the testing, the notched specimens were conditioned at the temperature of 23±2°C and the relative humidity 50±5% for 40h. Before the impact testing, the depth and the width of the specimens were measured with a micrometer. The specimens were tested using an impact tester (Tinius Olsen 92T). Ten specimens of each sample were tested and the mean values and standard deviations were calculated.', 'The <i>J</i>-integral test was conducted on a universal testing machine (Sintech 10/D) at room temperature following ASTM Standard E813-87. Single edge notched three-point bending (SEN-3PB) specimen geometry was adopted. The dimensions of the SEN-3PB specimen were 3.5mm in thickness (<i>B</i>), 12.5mm in width (<i>W</i>) and 65mm in length (<i>L</i>). A pre-crack, <i>a</i>, of approximately 6.2mm (i.e. <i>a</i>/<i>W</i>=0.5) was introduced at the centre of one edge of the rectangular bars. The pre-crack consisted of a saw slot and a sharp crack tip, which was created by pushing a fresh razor blade at the bottom of the saw slot. The crosshead speed was 10mm/min and multiple specimen technique was employed in the construction of the <i>J</i>–<i>R</i> curves.', 'Following the experimental procedure of the multiple specimen technique, the specimen was unloaded, when the load–displacement curve reached a certain position, where a required crack extension was attained. The deformed specimen was then immersed in a liquid nitrogen bath for 20min. The frozen specimen was fast fractured by a hammer and wedge immediately after the liquid nitrogen treatment. The length of the stress-whitened zone between the end of the pre-crack and the commencement of the fast fracture was regarded as the true crack extension, Δ<i>a</i>, which was measured by a traveling microscope.']]]
