[['Grafting PGMA onto TiO2 particles', ["As shown by [fig1]\n                        , near mono-dispersed, highly crystalline anatase TiO2 NPs were prepared with a two-phase synthetic approach. The particle size and size distribution were determined by sampling 200 particles from the TEM image using Image J software. It shows a number average size of 5\xa0nm in diameter, which agrees well with the estimation from the broadening of the (101) anatase XRD peak using the Scherrer's formula (5.4\xa0nm). The as-synthesized TiO2 NPs can be easily dispersed into chloroform solvent forming a transparent dispersion as demonstrated by the photograph in [fig1]c due to the capping of oleic acid during the synthesis.", 'As shown in [sch1]\n                        , PGMA chains were grafted onto TiO2 NP surfaces <i>via</i> a combination of robust organo-phosphate ligand anchoring and simple Cu(I) catalyzed alkyne-azide “click” reaction [bib14 bib15]. The synthetic oleic acid capping agent on the TiO2 NP surfaces was exchanged with an azido-phosphate ligand which has a stronger binding capability with TiO2 NPs. The azide terminal groups allow for the attachment of PGMA chains using “click” chemistry. The successful attachment of alkyne-PGMA was evidenced by the reduced intensity of the azide group in the FTIR spectrum as shown by [fig2]\n                        . However, after the reaction, a small residual peak was still observed indicating that not all the surface azide terminal groups were reacted. This is because the simple “grafting to” method has a constraint in the maximum graft density that can be obtained.', 'To investigate the influence of PGMA molecular weight on the maximum achievable graft density, alkyne-PGMA with different molecular weights were grafted onto the same batch of TiO2 NPs. TGA curves in [fig3]\n                         show an increased weight loss after grafting with PGMA chains, further indicating successful attachment <i>via</i> the simple “click” reaction. Using Eq. [fd1], the graft densities of PGMA chains were estimated from the TGA weight loss due to the decomposition of the grafted PGMA chains. The density and the radius of the anatase phase particles were estimated to be 3.87\xa0g\xa0cm−3 and 2.5\xa0nm, respectively. The weight loss of grafted PGMA chains (<i>z</i>) was calculated by comparing the TGA weight loss difference between the azido-phosphate functionalized particles and particles grafted with PGMA chains.', '[fig4]\n                         shows that the graft density (<i>σ</i>) scales inversely with the molecular weight through a power law (\n                           \n                              σ\n                              ∼\n                              \n                                 N\n                                 \n                                    −\n                                    0.73\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        ), where <i>N</i> is the number of repeating units of the grafted PGMA chains. In the “grafting to” method, the amount of polymer that can be attached is limited for both kinetic and thermodynamic reasons [bib21 bib22]. During the experiment, it was found that the maximum graft density was determined by the size of the grafted chains and not by the reactant concentration. The same graft density was obtained when increasing the reactant weight ratio of alkyne-PGMA to TiO2 NPs from 1:1 to 4:1. The “click” reaction proceeded very efficiently and the particle surfaces were quickly coated with a certain number of PGMA chains. As more and more polymer chains are grafted onto the surface, the polymer concentration near the particles soon becomes higher than the concentration in solution. Additional chains must then diffuse against this concentration gradient to reach the surface and further attachment of polymer becomes kinetically hindered. Thermodynamically, as the graft density increases, the grafted polymer chains must adopt a stretched conformation to avoid chain overlap. However, the loss of entropy during chain stretching is offset only by the formation of a single chemical bond, so the attachment of further chains rapidly becomes unfavorable. With the maximum achievable graft densities, the distance between two grafting sites is smaller than twice the radius of gyration, therefore the PGMA chains grafted to the TiO2 particles exist in a stretched polymer brush regime [bib22].']], ['Dispersion behavior of PGMA-grafted TiO2 NPs within epoxy', ['The grafted PGMA chains have epoxide functional groups making the grafted TiO2 particle compatible with epoxy resins. [fig5]\n                         presents the experimental dispersion phase diagram of the PGMA-grafted TiO2 particles in the epoxy matrix. With the maximum graft densities, the PGMA-brush-grafted particles showed a homogeneous dispersion within the epoxy matrix and transparent nanocomposites were obtained. To lower the graft density, smaller weight ratios of alkyne-PGMA to phosphate-treated particles were used in the “click” reaction. Accordingly, the graft density decreased continuously and the grafted chains gradually transitioned from brush to mushroom conformation. Near the “brush-to-mushroom” transition points, the dispersion of PGMA-grafted TiO2 particles abruptly changed from a homogeneously dispersed state to an agglomerated state. With lower graft density, the behavior of the grafted particles more closely resembles unmodified particles as their surfaces are not fully covered with polymer chains. At very low graft densities, the strong inter-particle attraction dominates due to insufficient surface coverage leading to agglomeration.', 'As shown by TEM images in [fig6]\n                        , the PGMA-10K brush-grafted TiO2 particles were homogeneously dispersed and individually separated particles were clearly observed at high magnification. Similar uniform dispersions of the other molecular weight PGMA-brush-grafted particles are shown by the TEM images in [appsec2]. At a low graft density, [fig6]c and [fig6] show that the sparsely grafted particles formed agglomerates with sizes ranging from sub-micrometer to 50\xa0nm. Near the large agglomerates, string-like structures of grafted particles were observed. Under high magnification, the formation of clusters was clearly seen. This is different from unmodified particles, which usually form spherical agglomerates within the polymer matrix due to the isotropic van der Waals attraction between particles. For the low graft density particles, the grafted PGMA chains need to rearrange their conformation to accommodate the strong core–core attraction, resulting in the anisotropic string-like morphology in the epoxy resin. As demonstrated in [appsec2], the segregation of low graft density particles and the formation of connected particle clusters were also observed for other grafted chain molecular weight. This is the first time the anisotropic assembly of low graft density particles within thermosetting polymer matrix was observed similar to that was reported in the grafted silica polystyrene nanocomposites [bib8]. The inhomogeneous dispersion and formation of micro-sized aggregates introduced strong scattering loss of transparency evidenced by the opaque nanocomposite sample. During the dispersing process, it was noticed that the transition from well-dispersed state to aggregated state can be easily identified as the graft density decreased. The obvious transition might be related to the fact that the low graft density particles encountered an “allophobic dewetting” transition, which is a discontinuous, first-order transition [bib18]. The large refractive index mismatch between TiO2 NPs and epoxy matrix leads to high sensitivity of the transparency of the nanocomposites to the dispersion state of the NPs.']], ['Theoretical prediction of dispersion of PGMA-grafted TiO2 NPs within epoxy', ['To enable theoretical predictions of the dispersion behavior of the grafted NPs in the epoxy matrix, we adapted the parametric phase diagram previously reported by Pryamtisyn et\xa0al. [bib23] for our specific dispersion systems (see [appsec2]). As indicated by this model, the dispersion state of grafted NPs was determined by the balance between the enthalpic gain from the contact between two NPs and the\xa0entropic repulsion due to the deformation of grafted chains. The energetic gain was estimated from the van der Waals attraction between two NPs within the epoxy resin medium. Given that the synthesized TiO2 particles were capped with oleic acid, the particles were modeled as core–shell structured particles and the van der Waals attraction between these particles was considered as the driving force for forming agglomerations [bib24 bib25]. As shown in [fig7]\n                        , a dispersion boundary demarcates the whole phase diagram into a well-dispersed region (<i>D</i>) and an agglomerated phase region (<i>A</i>). Transparent nanocomposites are expected only within the <i>D</i> region. The experimental dispersion results of TiO2 NPs grafted with PGMA of different molecular weights are also plotted within the phase diagram. The theoretical prediction and the experimental observations are in agreement as at maximum graft densities the grafted particles are within the well-dispersed region, and at very low graft density they fall into the aggregated region. Moreover, for a fixed grafted chain molecular weight the phase diagram precisely captures the transition from well-dispersed state to aggregated state. Similar to the dispersion diagram shown in [fig5], the dispersion window defined by the region between maximum achievable graft densities and critical graft densities to achieve good dispersion is narrow.', 'Different from scaling law predictions about the graft density relationship of “allophobic dewetting” [bib18 bib26 bib27], this parametric model clearly demonstrates that the critical graft densities are affected by both the grafted chain and the matrix molecular weight. [fig4] further shows that with long grafted chains the dispersion boundary becomes flatter, which is also consistent with the tendency seen in [fig5]. It is the utilization of a very small molecular weight epoxy matrix (340\xa0g\xa0mol−1) that results in the expansion of the <i>D</i> region and the near flat transition curve. It also implies that due to the compromise between achievable graft density and grafted chain molecular weight, grafting PGMA chains with a small molecular weight at relatively high graft densities would be ideal for obtaining good dispersions. During the preparation of nanocomposites, the PGMA-grafted particles were first mixed with the epoxy resin (part A). It was found that the dispersion of particles in this step determines the final dispersion and appearance of the cross-linked nanocomposites. This means the thermodynamic compatibility between grafted particles and epoxy matrix plays more important role in achieving good dispersion of particles within the epoxy matrix. In the cross-link step, the epoxy chains will form connected network and their molecular weight will increase dramatically. However, the PGMA-grafted particles were kinetically trapped and their dispersion states were not changed. Meanwhile, it should be pointed out that the synthesized near mono-disperse TiO2 particles and grafted PGMA chains with very narrow PDI favor accurate prediction from the dispersion phase diagram. The final dispersion and morphology of the grafted particles is determined by the balance between the van der Waals attractions of the high-<i>n</i> TiO2 particles and entropic forces associated with the deformations of the grafted PGMA chains [bib23 bib24]. The easy formation of anisotropic self-assembly instead of spherical agglomerates can be understood from the fact that the agglomerated states are actually very close to the dispersion boundary and the boundary was obtained by equating the free energy between the individually dispersed state and the string-like morphology in this modified model [bib24].']], ['Optical properties of TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites', ['Transparent TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites were prepared by using PGMA-brush-grafted particles as fillers. As shown in [fig8]\n                        a, the refractive index of the nanocomposite increased from 1.5 for neat epoxy to 1.62 with 30\xa0wt% anatase TiO2 NPs. The increase of refractive index is accurately predicted by the rule of mixtures. The transmittance spectra in [fig8]b show that the thick sample demonstrated a transparency of approximately 85% and 75% for 10\xa0wt% and 30\xa0wt% particle loading concentration, respectively. However, the transparency decreased very rapidly in the 400–600\xa0nm range and the higher loading sample strongly blocked the short wavelength blue light. It was noticed that the synthesized TiO2 NPs appear light yellow in solvent despite their high transparency as shown in [fig1]c. Hence, the resultant TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites were also yellow as shown by the inset photographs, meaning that the nanocomposites absorb the low wavelength blue light. The absorption of blue light (400–600\xa0nm) becomes stronger for high filler loading and thicker nanocomposite samples.', 'Rayleigh scattering law as described in Eq. [fd2] was used to understand the decreased transparency in the long visible wavelength range [bib4 bib28].\n                           \n                              (2)\n

[fd1], the optical transmittance spectra after considering the Rayleigh scattering loss is also shown in [fig8]b. For the case of the 10\xa0wt% TiO2/epoxy nanocomposite sample, the theoretical prediction of transparency dependence on wavelength agrees well with experimental observations in terms of both the slope of the transmittance spectrum and the decreased value. For the 30\xa0wt% TiO2/epoxy nanocomposite sample, the Rayleigh scattering model predicts an average decrease of transparency around 5%, which is lower than the experimentally observed transparency difference (10%) in the range of 600–800\xa0nm.', 'Considering the dense distribution of TiO2 NPs in the 30\xa0wt% nanocomposite sample ([fig9]\n                        ), it might be possible that the scattering centers are not single particles. However, [fig8]b shows that when imposing the assumption that the scattering center is composed of two NPs, the transparency loss is overestimated and the slope is larger than the measured spectrum. Therefore, it appears that due to good dispersion of the grafted particles within the epoxy matrix, the transparency loss could be reasonably predicted by the Rayleigh scattering law with scattering centers being individual particles. Actually, the theoretical predicted spectrum with single particle as the scattering center shows a similar slope as experimental measured curve. The two spectra are parallel with each other within the range of 600–800\xa0nm. The transparency discrepancy might be attributed to the strict assumption regarding the scattering particles in the Rayleigh model. The Rayleigh model works better for dispersion of very low loading concentrations of spherical particles [bib29 bib30]. The multiple scattering arising from high filler loading and large thickness may be responsible for the observed discrepancy in the 30\xa0wt% TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites. Furthermore, the high loading 30\xa0wt% sample (<i>n</i>\xa0=\xa01.62) would have a 4% higher reflection loss at the air/composite interface compared with the 10\xa0wt% sample. This increased reflection loss also contributes to the decreased transmittance and deviation from theoretical prediction.']]]
