[['Materials', ['Titanium (IV) butoxide (97%, Sigma Aldrich), oleic acid (90%, Sigma Aldrich), triethylamine (70%, Aldrich) and toluene (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) were used for the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles. POCl3 (99.99%) and NaN3 (Sigma Aldrich) and 11 bromo-1-undecanol (Acros) were used for synthesis of azido-phosphate. Cu(I)Br (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) was purified with acetic acid and washed with ethanol and diethyl ether three times. <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>′,<i>N</i>″,<i>N</i>″-Pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) was obtained from Acros Organics and used as received. Epoxy 301-1 (two parts kit) was purchased from Epoxy Technology. Part A is the epoxy resin (bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether) with a molecular weight around 340\xa0g\xa0mol−1 and part B is the cross-linking agent (triethyl-1, 6 hexanediamine).']], ['Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles', ['The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized through a two-phase synthetic approach where the particles were formed at the interface between the organic and aqueous phase [bib19]. In a typical synthesis, to a stainless steel pressure vessel (45\xa0mL, Parr), DI water (10\xa0mL) and triethylamine (0.5\xa0mL) were added and homogeneously mixed. The organic phase was prepared by mixing the solution of toluene (20\xa0mL), titanium butoxide (1\xa0mL) and oleic acid (3\xa0mL) in a separate beaker. Then the organic solution was poured into the pressure vessel. The vessel was sealed tightly and transferred into an isotemp oven at 200\xa0°C for 12\xa0h. After reaction, the top transparent toluene solution was extracted by a pipette. The particles were precipitated with ethanol and recovered with centrifugation.']], ['Surface modification of TiO2 particles', ['11-Azidoundecyl dihydrogen phosphate was synthesized with a simple two-step reaction based on our previous work [bib15], and was used as the binding ligand. Alkyne-terminated PGMA was synthesized with a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique, as described in detail elsewhere [bib14]. Alkyne-PGMA with other molecular weights was made with the similar procedure but different reaction durations. As listed in [tbl1]\n                        , alkyne-PGMA polymers with four different molecular weights (<i>M</i>\n                        \n                           <i>n</i>\n                        ) and low polydispersity index (PDI, \n                           \n                        ) were synthesized with the well-controlled RAFT technique.', 'A mixture of the as-synthesized anatase TiO2 particles and 11-azidoundecyl dihydrogen phosphate with a weight ratio of 1:1 dispersed in chloroform was subjected to stirring at reflux overnight. The phosphate-treated particles were washed with ethanol, centrifuged and redispersed into chloroform. This precipitation-redispersion process was repeated two more times to get the final azide functionalized particles in chloroform.', 'In a typical “click” reaction, 0.4\xa0g of phosphate-treated TiO2 particles, 0.5\xa0g of alkyne-PGMA, 20\xa0μL of PMDETA ligand were added into 60\xa0mL anhydrous THF. 10\xa0mg of CuBr was added into the flask and the solution was bubbled with argon gas for 5\xa0min. The flask was then transferred into an oil bath at 55\xa0°C for 48\xa0h. The grafted particles were precipitated with methanol and redispersed into chloroform. To identify the maximum achievable graft density, the “click” reaction was carried out with the weight ratio of the phosphate-treated TiO2 particle to alkyne-PGMA ranging from 1:1 to 1:4. To prepare low graft density PGMA-grafted TiO2 particles, higher particle to alkyne-PGMA weight ratios (2:1, 4:1 and 6:1) were used in the “click” reaction.', 'To remove the possible unattached PGMA, after the “click” reaction, the obtained grafted particle solution was precipitated with methanol and recovered with high speed (12\xa0000\xa0rpm) centrifugation. The obtained particles were redispersed into chloroform. It was found that the un-grafted PGMA was precipitated on top of the grafted particles in the centrifuge tube probably due to the density difference between the pure PGMA polymers and PGMA-grafted TiO2 particles. During the redispersion process, the top PGMA layer dissolved first while it took longer time before the grafted particles were dispersed. The separation of unattached PGMA was further confirmed by the 100% weight loss from the TGA measurement of the initially dissolved part. This centrifugation and redispersion process was repeated for two more times until there is no change in the TGA weight loss of the grafted particles. At the same time, the supernatant was checked with an FTIR spectrometer until there is no any observed alkyne-PGMA peaks.']], ['Characterization', ['X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the synthesized particles were obtained with a Bruker D8 Discover XRD diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (<i>λ</i>\xa0=\xa01.5405\xa0Å) and operating at an accelerating voltage of 40\xa0kV, in the 2θ range from 10 to 80° (step of 0.01°). Transmission electron micrographs were taken on a JEOL-2010 operating at 200\xa0kV. The TEM samples were prepared by microtoming the composites into 50–70\xa0nm thick slices. The refractive index dispersion of the composites was measured by variable angle spectroscopy ellipsometer (VASE, J.A. Woollam Co., Inc. EC-400) on a spin-coated sample on a Si wafer. The measured results were fitted with the Cauchy model. Transmittance spectra were obtained with a Perkin–Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer using air as the reference. The nanocomposite samples were prepared by mixing PGMA-grafted TiO2 particle dispersion in chloroform with Epoxy 301-1 part A (bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether) and removing solvent under vacuum. Then, Epoxy 301-1 part B (cross-linking agent) was added with a weight ratio of 1:4 with respect to part A. The mixture was poured into a glass mold and heated at 80\xa0°C for 30\xa0min. The bulk transparent nanocomposite samples were placed in perpendicular to the incident light to measure the transmittance.', "FTIR spectra were obtained on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR Spectrophotometer scanning from 500 to 4000\xa0cm−1 with a resolution of 4\xa0cm−1 for 10 scans. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was done on a Perkin Elmer Series 7 instrument. The TGA samples were thoroughly dried under an oven at 120\xa0°C overnight. The sample was heated from 30 to 700\xa0°C under a 60\xa0ml\xa0min−1 nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10\xa0°C/min. Graft density of PGMA chains was estimated based on TGA weight loss due to decomposition of the grafted chains with the following equation [bib20]:\n                           \n                              (1)\n                              \n                                 \n                                    σ\n                                    =\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             (\n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   \n                                                      w\n                                                      \n                                                         N\n                                                         A\n                                                      \n                                                   \n                                                   /\n                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                         M\n                                                         n\n                                                      \n                                                   \n                                                \n                                             \n                                             )\n                                          \n                                       \n                                       /\n                                       \n                                          \n                                             (\n                                             \n                                                4\n                                                π\n                                                \n                                                   a\n                                                   2\n                                                \n                                                n\n                                             \n                                             )\n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                    =\n                                    a\n                                    ρ\n                                    \n                                       N\n                                       A\n                                    \n                                    ×\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                10\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                −\n                                                21\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                       /\n                                       \n                                          3\n                                          (\n                                          1\n                                          −\n                                          z\n                                          )\n                                          \n                                             M\n                                             n\n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>w</i>, <i>N</i>\n                        \n                           <i>A</i>\n                        , <i>M</i>\n                        \n                           <i>n</i>\n                        , <i>a</i>, <i>ρ</i>, <i>n</i> and <i>z</i> are the weight of organic polymers, Avogadro's number, molecular weight of grafted chains, radius of particles, density of particles, the number of NPs and weight loss of polymer chains, respectively."]]]
