['In summary, we report a simple approach to develop bulk transparent, high-<i>n</i> TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites by filling a commercial epoxy resin with PGMA-brush-grafted anatase TiO2 NPs. With the maximum achieved graft densities in the “grafting to” method, the grafted PGMA chains existed in the brush regime. An abrupt transition from good dispersion to agglomerate formation arises when the graft density was too low to form polymer brushes. Furthermore, we adapted a parametric model to quantitatively analyze the dispersion transition and showed good agreement with experimental observations. The prepared epoxy nanocomposites filled with PGMA-brush-grafted TiO2 NPs demonstrated tunable optical properties. Their refractive index increased linearly with the filler volume fraction and their transparency was well described by the Rayleigh scattering model.']
