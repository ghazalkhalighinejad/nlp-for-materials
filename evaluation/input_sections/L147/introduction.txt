['Combining the advantages such as high optical transparency and excellent processability from organic components with the added functionality from inorganic nanofillers, polymer nanocomposites can exhibit diverse functional properties, and are already used for a variety of important applications [bib1 bib2 bib3]. For optical applications such as encapsulation of light emitting diodes (LEDs), polymer matrices filled with high-refractive-index (high-<i>n</i>) nanoparticles (NPs) would increase the refractive index of the encapsulant, and thereby the light extraction efficiency of LEDs [bib4]. So far, most reported research has been focused on high-<i>n</i> nanocomposite thin films with a typical thickness less than 50\xa0μm [bib2]. To be used as high-<i>n</i> LED encapsulant or lens materials, bulk nanocomposites with a thickness of 1\xa0mm are desired. Compared with various <i>in situ</i> preparation methods, <i>ex situ</i> synthesis of optical NPs and direct incorporation into the polymer matrix provides the flexibility of choosing inorganic and organic building blocks with well-defined properties and thus the possibility of tuning the properties of the nanocomposites [bib2]. However, a critical obstacle to the fabrication of transparent nanocomposites <i>via</i> the <i>ex situ</i> route is controlling the size and size distribution of functional NPs, and more importantly the dispersion of inorganic fillers within polymer matrices since inorganic NPs are prone to aggregation in polymers [bib5].', 'One general and effective approach to dispersing NPs within a polymer matrix is to graft inorganic NPs with polymer chains having the same or similar chemical composition as the matrix polymer [bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9]. Although this particle dispersion approach is successful in the most extensively explored silica/polymer nanocomposite systems, in most cases these NPs were grafted with high density polymer brushes using surface-initiated “grafting from” methods [bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13]. By contrast, very few studies have been carried out in the preparation of transparent thick high-<i>n</i> nanocomposites <i>via</i> the simple “grafting to” approach. Epoxy represents a class of thermosetting polymeric materials with extensive and important industrial applications ranging from coatings to adhesives and electronic and optical devices packaging such as encapsulation for LEDs. Therefore, a simple and versatile method to homogeneously disperse functional NPs in the epoxy matrix is urgently needed. Grafting inorganic NPs with poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) has been shown to be able to improve the dispersion of NPs within epoxy matrices and prepare highly transparent thin film coatings [bib14 bib15]. The dispersion of the grafted particles within polymer matrices has been reported to be affected by the graft density, the grafted/matrix chain length ratio, as well as the particle size [bib7 bib8 bib9 bib16 bib17 bib18]. However, very little quantitative information is available on the dispersion behavior despite the ubiquity of polymers filled with homogeneously dispersed grafted particles. Thus, a more quantitative prediction of the dispersion state of grafted NPs would provide a guideline for practical fabrication of transparent polymer nanocomposites.', 'Generally, densely grafted thick polymer layers are desired for achieving good screening of the NP core–core attraction and hence good dispersion in the polymer matrix. On the other hand, to improve the refractive index of the nanocomposites effectively, a sufficiently high loading concentration of high-<i>n</i> NPs is needed. Therefore, achieving good dispersion of high-<i>n</i> NPs within polymer matrices with the minimum amount of grafted polymer is critical to the practical fabrication of high-<i>n</i> nanocomposites. In this work, we experimentally studied the dispersion behavior of PGMA-grafted TiO2 NPs within an epoxy matrix through varying the graft density and molecular weight of the grafted PGMA chains. We further built a predictive dispersion phase diagram for the dispersion of PGMA-grafted TiO2 NPs within the epoxy matrix, which agrees well with experimental observations. Finally, based upon the comprehensive understanding and effective control of the dispersion behavior of PGMA-grafted TiO2 particles within the commercial epoxy matrix, bulk transparent high-<i>n</i> TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites were successfully prepared.']
