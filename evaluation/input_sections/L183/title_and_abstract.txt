Morphology and electrical resistivity of melt mixed blends of polyethylene and carbon nanotube filled polycarbonate
Blends were prepared from a high density polyethylene (PE) material and a conductive polycarbonate (PC) composite containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT). The PC composite contained 2wt% MWNT and was prepared by diluting a PC masterbatch consisting of 15wt% MWNT by melt mixing in an extruder. The aim of blending a conductive PC composite with PE was to obtain a conductive blend at lower amounts of MWNT than required for the pure PC component. The blend morphology was found to be co-continuous over a broad composition range of 30–80vol.% of the filled PC phase as verified by selective extraction of PC and morphological investigations. The co-continuous structure is very fine with ligaments in the range of 1 μm. Significantly reduced volume resistivity values, i.e. in the range of 107
                     Ωcm, could be achieved in the same composition range of that of the continuous PC phase, i.e. starting at compositions of 30vol.% filled PC. Here, the total MWNT content in the blend was only 0.41vol.%. Interestingly, even if the MWNT had been incorporated in the PC phase, the tubes are still visible in the blends after selective extraction of PC. Scanning electron microscopy investigations revealed that the MWNT bridge the PC and PE phases, at least with their ends. This can be understood by the length dimensions of the tubes, which is higher than the phase sizes in the blends.
