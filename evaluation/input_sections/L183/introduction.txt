['Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been shown to be an attractive filler for increasing the electrical conductivity of polymers at relatively low CNT contents. This efficient behavior is caused by the excellent electrical properties (CNT are as conductive as copper) and the very high aspect ratios, <i>p</i> (<i>p</i>=<i>L</i>/<i>D</i>, where <i>L</i>=length, 1–50 μm and <i>d</i>=diameter, 1–50 nm) of the fibrous CNT. The percolation concentration, i.e. the filler concentration at which a pathway of conductive filler is formed through the matrix, which is manifested in changes of resistivity over decades, is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the CNTs. According to theoretical calculations or cylindrically shaped fillers [BIB1], the onset of percolation of polymer/MWNT composites is expected to begin at ∼0.05vol.% filler (assuming an aspect ratio of 1000). The lowest percolation concentrations reported in the literature are 0.04wt% for an epoxy/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites [BIB2] and 0.05wt% found for polypropylene/MWNT films [BIB3]. Most experimental studies on polymer/MWNT composites, however, report percolation between 1–5vol.% [BIB4 BIB5 BIB6 BIB7 BIB8] which is still much lower than the filler concentration necessary for percolation in systems with carbon black (CB) or metallic fillers. In addition, mechanical enhancement is expected by using CNTs which exhibit very high moduli and strength [BIB9 BIB10 BIB11].', 'Based on the above characteristics of CNT, it is also promising to use them as additives in polymer blends for electrically conductive or antistatic applications and achieving, at the same time, the well-known advantages of polymer blending for tailor-made material properties. When dispersing CNTs in the blends of two or more polymers that are immiscible, the conductive filler can be located either in one or both of the phases or at the interface. The resulting electrical properties will depend on the location of the conductive filler as well as on the blend morphology; this has been shown extensively for carbon black filled polymer systems. For CB filled blends, Sumita et al. [BIB12] first introduced the concept of ‘double percolation’ in which the percolation of the carbon black occurs in a phase that is also continuous thus creating a second percolation. Gubbels et al. and Calberg et al. [BIB13 BIB14 BIB15] showed that the selective localization of CB at the interface between PE and PS that form a co-continuous blend can dramatically reduce the amount of CB needed for percolation. For example, a PE/PS=45/55wt% blend requires only 0.5wt% CB to achieve resistivities lower than 104\n                     Ωcm [BIB13]. This selective localization at the interface depends on the polymer/polymer interfacial tension relative to the interfacial tensions of CB and the individual polymers. On the other hand, the composition range in which co-continuous structures are found as well as the stability of this structure are enhanced by the CB filler [BIB14]. This effect was explained by enhancement of melt viscosity leading to a reduction of coalescence in the filled polymer phase(s). Investigations on short carbon fiber filled polymer blends were reported by Zhang et al. [BIB16]. Vapor grown carbon fibers having an average diameter of 200 nm and lengths on the order of 10 μm were added to premixed blends of HDPE and PMMA. The filler content needed for percolation in a 50/50 blends was 1.25phr which was much lower than the percolation thresholds of the individual components. This was attributed to a segregation of carbon fibers in the PE phase due to their higher affinity for PE relative to PMMA.', 'Recently, GE Plastics introduced a conductive nanotube filled, impact-toughened polyphenylene ether (PPE)/polyamide (PA) blend (grade name NORYL GTX 990EP resin) in which PA 6,6 forms the matrix and PPE the dispersed phase [BIB17]. Addition of MWNT to this blend system requires relatively low nanotube loadings to achieve resistivities lower than 106\n                     Ωcm, thus making this material suitable for electrostatic painting applications [BIB17]. Aside from this particular blend system, few reports are available in the literature involving the use of carbon nanotubes in polymer blends. Valentini et al. [BIB18] showed results concerning the addition of SWNT into PP-EPDM blends and studied the influence of the nanotubes on the crystallization behavior of the components and the dynamic mechanical behavior at a given composition of PP/EPDM=70/30. At this composition the blends exhibit matrix-dispersed particle structures. Electrical properties were not investigated.', 'This paper deals with blends of polyethylene (PE) and polycarbonate (PC) by using carbon nanotubes as a conductive filler. Carbon nanotubes are first introduced into polycarbonate using a masterbatch technique, which are expected to remain in this phase during melt mixing with PE. This blending strategy is indented to produce conductive blends containing much lower contents of CNT than required for the pure PC component. It is of interest here to also investigate the applicability the concept of double percolation for the given blend. In order to get conductive blends as a result of mixing, a continuous structure of the filled PC phase is necessary. In other words, the filled PC should form the matrix of a dispersed blend or exhibit a continuous phase in a co-continuous blend. PE was selected as a model component because of its immiscibility with PC.']
