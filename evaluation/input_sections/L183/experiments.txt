[['Materials and blend preparation', ['High density polyethylene (PE, Lupolen® 4261A, BASF AG, Germany) was blended with a PC composite containing 2wt% MWNT (PC-2NT) to produce a full range of blend compositions. Compounding of these blends was carried out with a 4 g capacity DACA Micro Compounder (DACA Instruments, Goleta, USA) operating at 260 °C, 50 rpm, and a mixing time of 5 min. Additional experiments were conducted using longer mixing times (up to 15 min) and higher mixing speeds (up to 150 rpm). The original PC-2NT composite was produced by diluting a masterbatch of 15wt% MWNT in polycarbonate, supplied by Hyperion Catalysis International, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA), with pure PC (Iupilon E-2000, Mitsubishi Engineering Plastics) using a Haake co-rotating, intermeshing twin-screw extruder (<i>D</i>=30, <i>L</i>/<i>D</i>=10) as previously described [BIB7]. The final blends obtained after melt compounding in the DACA Micro Compounder were formed into a continuous strand using a heated cylindrical die (2 mm diameter, length 35 mm). The strands were placed on an aluminium plate without additional cooling or drawing. An additional blend using PC with 5wt% (PC-5NT) in a PC-5NT/PE=45/55vol.% composition was prepared at 260 °C, 150 rpm, and a mixing time of 5 min.']], ['Rheological measurements', ['Melt rheological properties were obtained using an ARES oscillatory rheometer (Rheometric Scientific) at 260 °C in nitrogen atmosphere using a parallel plate geometry (plates 25 mm diameter, gap of 1–2 mm). Granules and/or small pieces of extrudate strands were placed between the preheated plates and allowed to equilibrate for about 3 min. Frequency sweeps were performed between 0.1 and 100rad/s at strains within the linear viscoelastic range. Repeated sweeps with increasing and decreasing frequency were performed in order to check the stability of the sample over time (each sweep requires approximately 8 min). In most cases, the second sweep was interpretated.']], ['Electrical resistivity', ['The volume resistivity was measured on compression molded samples (diameter 60 mm, thickness 0.35 mm) which were prepared by pressing extrudate strand pieces using a Voit press at 260 °C. A Keithley electrometer Model 6517 equipped with a 8002A High Resistance Test Fixture was used to measure high resistivity samples. For lower resistivity blends and PC-2NT samples of 20 mm in length and 3 mm in width were cut from the pressed films and measured with a 4-point test fixture equipped with gold contact wires (distance between the source electrodes 20 mm and between the measuring electrodes 7.1 mm) using a Keithley electrometer Model 2000. The samples were thoroughly cleaned with ethanol prior to measurements. The measured volume resistance, <i>R</i>\n                        v, was converted to volume resistivity, <i>ρ</i>\n                        v, according to ASTM D4496 and D257 using the formula\n                           \n                              (1)\n                              ρ\n                                    v\n                                 =R\n                                    v\n                                 A/t\n                           \n                        (where <i>A</i>=effective area of the measuring electrode and <i>t</i>=specimen thickness).']], ['Microscopic characterization', ['Test specimens for atomic force microscopy (AFM) were prepared by cutting the strand perpendicular to the extrusion direction at room temperature using a Leica RM 2155 microtome (Leica, Germany) equipped with a diamond knife. Blends with PE were cut at approximately −60 °C. The AFM measurements were carried out in the tapping mode using a Dimension 3100 NanoScope IV (Veeco, USA) [BIB19].', 'Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on samples coated with gold using a LEO VP 435 scanning electron microscope (Leo Elektronenmikroskopie, Oberkochen, Germany). For select samples, a low voltage Zeiss Gemini DSM 982 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany) was used on uncoated samples. Photomicrographs were taken of cryofractured extruded strands. In some cases the strands were selectively dissolved with chloroform for 4 days at room temperature to remove the PC portion of the blend prior to cryofracturing.']], ['Determination of PC phase continuity by selective extraction', ['Extruded strands of blends, ∼2 cm length, were dried for 8 h at 80 °C and subsequently immersed in 50 ml of chloroform at room temperature for 4 days. After the first day the chloroform-PC solution was replaced by fresh chloroform. The extracted strands were then rinsed in fresh chloroform and dried at 105 °C to remove the chloroform. The phase continuity was calculated using the ratio of the dissolvable PC part to that of PC in the blend, where the dissolvable PC part is the weight difference between the sample before and after extraction and the PC part in the blend is calculated from the sample weight before extraction and the weight percentage of PC. The continuity gives a measure of the fraction of PC associated with the continuous PC phase. The reported values are the average of two samples.']]]
