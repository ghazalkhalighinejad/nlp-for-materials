[['Blend morphology and co-continuous composition range', ['The aim of mixing PE with a carbon nanotube filled PC material was to form a co-continuous phase structure between both polymeric components such that the filled PC forms a continuous phase acting as electrical pathway through the sample volume. The formation of co-continuous structures in melt mixed blends primarily depends on the viscosity and elasticity ratios between the blend components at the mixing conditions, whereas the interfacial tension is mainly related to the stability of the morphology [BIB20]. To achieve continuity of the filled PC at low concentrations, the PC phase should have a melt viscosity lower than PE under the given mixing conditions. However, as it was shown in a previous paper [BIB7] the melt viscosity of nanotube filled composites is increasing significantly above the filler percolation threshold. This is much more pronounced at low oscillation frequencies but also found at shear rates as applied during mixing. Thus a high viscosity PE material was selected to ensure that its viscosity was higher than that of the filled PC over a broad range of frequencies. The viscosity curves of the PC-2NT, neat PC, neat PE, and a blend of PC-2NT with PE are shown in [FIG1]\n                         at 260 °C. Comparing pure PC with the extruded PC-2NT composite clearly shows that a qualitative change in the viscosity vs. frequency behavior has taken place. At low frequencies, the PC shows a Newtonian plateau leading to a zero shear viscosity of 2670 Pa s, while the filled PC shows an increasing viscosity with decreasing the frequency without reaching a Newtonian plateau. This behavior is caused by the percolated structure of the MWNT within this sample [BIB7]. The PE selected shows a linear decrease in viscosity vs. frequency and is absent of a Newtonian plateau under the measurement conditions. The higher melt viscosity of the PC-2NT/PE=45/55vol.% blend at very low oscillation frequencies relative to its constituting components is already indicative of the formation of a co-continuous structure [BIB20 BIB23]. The mean shear rate at 50 rpm inside the DACA Micro Compounder is estimated to be ∼50 s−1 using the approach proposed by Dedecker and Groeninckx [BIB21]. At the shear stress of PE corresponding to this shear rate the ratio of PC-2NT viscosity to that of PE is 0.45. The phase inversion (PI) for these materials is expected to occur at a concentration (<i>φ</i>\n                        PC-2NT, PI) between 18 and 52vol.% of PC-2NT in PE, according to the Metelkin and Luciani models, respectively [BIB20] ([FIG2]). The most widely used model for phase inversion by Utracki (see Ref. [BIB20]) predicts a phase inversion composition at 41vol.%. However, these models do not give any information about the co-continuous composition range which is expected to encompass the phase inversion composition.', 'A viable method to investigate the co-continuous structure composition range is selective extraction. For the blend system used, PC can be extracted using chloroform, which does not dissolve, swell, or penetrate the polyethylene. Thus, the part of PC which can be extracted from the sample originates from the part of PC taking place in a continuous PC structure. An important criterion in selective extraction is that the sample after extraction must be self-supporting. Extraction experiments on strand samples met this criterion for concentrations up to 80vol.% PC-2NT. In addition, the strand samples did not change in shape or size following extraction. However, even if the MWNT were incorporated into PC, the chloroform-PC solution obtained during extraction was clear and the strand pieces remained the black color typical for all nanotube filled blends.', '[FIG3]\n                         shows the continuity index of PC as measured by the selective extraction experiments. This figure indicates that the PC forms a fully continuous structure between 30 and 80vol.% PC-2NT. At 20vol.% PC-2NT, 81wt% of the PC takes place in a continuous structure while 19wt% exists in PE as dispersed particles. Interestingly, this co-continuous composition range is very broad as compared to values reported in the literature (see references within [BIB20]).', 'SEM micrographs of cryofractured samples shown in [FIG4]\n                         provide visible evidence of a co-continuous structure, in addition, illustrate the poor adhesion between the two polymer phases. From AFM micrographs ([FIG5]) we can conclude that the phase having higher stiffness and smoother surface corresponds to the phase containing PC.', '[FIG6]\n                         shows SEM micrographs taken of different blend compositions that were cryofractured after selective extraction of PC. Each micrograph reveals a co-continuous structure in which PE forms a continuous phase. At 20vol.% PC-2NT, some spherical inclusions of PC in the remaining PE phase are visible. These particles were not dissolved during the selective PC extraction procedure since they were isolated within the PE and not accessible by the solvent. The co-continuous structure is very fine having ligaments in the range of 1 μm and varies only little in size over the entire range of compositions. Interestingly, above approximately 40vol.% PC-2NT the appearance of the structure changes from predominantly concave PE surfaces to predominantly convex PE surfaces. This composition coincides with the phase inversion composition predicted using the Utracki model. Starting at this composition, the structure contains a higher number of dispersed elongated PE particles connected by thin ligaments with increasing PC-2NT concentration. This effect is especially pronounced at 80vol.% PC-2NT (see also [FIG8]) where according to the volume ratio of PE and PC-2NT particles of PE are expected to be dispersed within the PC phase. However, it should be noted that at this composition the strand shape and size was unchanged after selective PC extraction indicating that the PE forms a continuous phase.', 'Variations in melt mixing conditions lead to minor changes in the structure as seen in [FIG4 FIG7]\n                         for blends containing 45vol.% PC-2NT. Increasing the screw speed from 50 to 150 rpm leads to a finer co-continuous morphology (see [FIG4]), while increasing mixing time from 5 to 15 min (compare [FIG6 FIG7]) has little effect on the morphology, thus, revealing the stable nature of the co-continuous morphology. In [FIG7] the morphology of a blend containing PC-5NT is shown at the same blend composition. The morphology is quite similar to that of the corresponding blend with PC-2NT.']], ['The effect of nanotube bridging', ['The blends described in this paper exhibit a stable co-continuous structure over an unusually large composition range. A reason for this behavior can be found by taking a closer look at the morphology. SEM on the extracted samples reveals that the nanotubes remain inside the sample after dissolving the PC phase and seem to connect the structure elements of the PE phase and/or different PE particles. This phenomenon, visible in [FIG5 FIG6 FIG7], is shown in greater detail in [FIG8]\n                        . In the extracted blend samples, tubes are visible at the surface of the cryofractured strand and in some cases they connect PE domains. In [FIG8], the tubes are partially visible along their length and appear to be stretched. The actual length of the nanotubes is more easily viewed in these micrographs of blends than those taken previously on PC-MWNT composites [BIB19]. [FIG8] shows that the observed tubes are not an artifact produced by cryofracturing the extracted strands. The AFM micrograph of the cryocut (non-extracted) surface also reveals bridging between the phases, as indicated by circled regions. This bridging behavior indicates that the tubes were not aligned within the continuous PC phase during the processing of the co-continuous blends. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that nanotubes within PC-MWNT composite strands are randomly oriented in the PC and do not align in flow direction under the extrusion conditions selected [BIB19]. Even if the phase size of the PC is much smaller in the co-continuous blends with PE (about 1 μm) as compared to the strand diameter (2 mm) in PC-MWNT composites, we may also assume that MWNT fail to align within the PC phase in the co-continuous blends. In fact, the nanotubes may tend to migrate to the PE phase owing to their good affinity for polyolefins [BIB12]. Such behavior has been observed in blends of polyethylene filled with carbon black [BIB12 BIB13 BIB22]. The level of migration, however, may be sizably less owing to the nanotube shape.', 'According to investigations on the mechanism of formation of co-continuous structures by melt mixing, the process of morphology development likely involves the breakup processes of thin sheets of both components into a lacy-like structure and to fibrous filaments which can break up to droplets (see Ref. [BIB20]). These breakup mechanisms seem to be delayed by the nanotubes since they enhance the viscosity of the filled component, as well as hinder the breakup of sheets or filaments mechanically. The latter effect may be explained by the length dimensions of the tubes, which are larger in size than the phase sizes (ligament sizes) of the PC phase in the blends. This stabilizing effect for the co-continuous morphology could be a major reason that the co-continuous composition range is very broad in this system and that the morphology fineness does not differ very much at different compositions.', 'In this context, it seems unlikely that the nanotubes, owing to their dimensions, can be located at the interface between both phases, as it was shown for carbon black.']], ['Electrical resistivity', ['Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that conductivity of the blends is strongly related to morphology. [FIG9]\n                         shows a significant drop in resistivity by about seven decades starting at 30vol.% PC-2NT which correlates to the lowest PC-2NT composition of the fully co-continuous range. The PC-2NT phase still exhibit a percolated structure, however, the resistivity values are not as low as in the PC-2NT phase itself. This is due to the localization of parts of nanotubes within the PE phase reducing the number of nanotube–nanotube contacts. The higher resistivity values of the pure PC-2NT material shown here as compared to those presented in Ref. [BIB7] is due to the additional second extrusion step of the filled material which seems to cause attrition of the MWNT as discussed in Ref. [BIB24]. For the blends, increasing mixing speed leads to comparable resistivity values despite finer structures observed at higher speed (compare [FIG7]). Longer mixing time enhances the resistivity slightly, which may also be attributed to reduced nanotube lengths. The PC-5NT/PE=45/55vol.% blend prepared at 150 rpm for 5 min exhibited a volume resistivity of 5×106\n                        Ωcm that exhibits a considerably higher resistivity than that of the extruded PC-5NT sample whose value is 35Ωcm. The attrition of nanotubes at high loadings and with mixing time may be more pronounced due to the nanotube bridging.', 'Another interesting point is that blends of selected compositions retain low resistivity values even after extraction of the PC phase. PC-2NT/PE=45/55vol.% blend strand pieces were pressed to sheets (diameter 60 mm, thickness 0.35 mm) and their resistivity were compared with those of extracted sheets after dissolving the PC part. The volume resistivity was nearly unchanged in the range of 108\n                        Ωcm. This result demonstrates the potential use of such co-continuous blends as basic material for the production of conductive/antistatic membranes.', 'Even though the blends resistivity values are not in the range of ‘conductive materials’, their resistivity is in the range of dissipative materials. At a composition of 30vol.% filled PC, the total content of MWNT in the blend is only 0.41vol.% (based on a volume concentration of 1.37vol.% in the PC-2NT composite [BIB7]).']]]
