['Barium hydroxide octahydrate (Xilong chemical Co. Ltd.), tetrabutyl titanate (Beijing Xingjin Chemical Corp.), N,N-dimethylformamide (Beijing Chemical Corp.) were used as the chemical reagents to prepare the BT nanoparticles. Semi-crystalline polymer PVDF (FR904) was obtained from Shanghai 3F New Materials Company. Pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), 4,4′-oxydianiline (ODA), and N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai Sanaisi Reagent Co., and Beijing Yili Fine Chemical Reagent Co., respectively.', 'BT nanoparticles with different diameters were prepared by the alkoxide route [b0090]. The BT/PVDF nanocomposite films were prepared by using solution casting method [b0090] while the BT/PI nanocomposite films using in situ polymerization [b0105 b0110]. The imidization condition for polyimide was as follows: 60°C for 1h, 100°C for 1h, 200°C for 1h, 300°C for 1h. The thickness of all as-prepared nanocomposite films were controlled in the thickness of about 100μm, and the BT concentration at 50vol.%.', 'Crystal phase structures and morphologies of BT particles and nanocomposite films were characterized by an X-ray diffraction instrument (Japan RigakuD/max-RC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSE-6301F), respectively. For the measurement of dielectric behavior, electrodes were painted by silver paste to ensure good electrical contact. The dielectric properties of all films at −40°C, 20°C and 80°C were measured in the frequency range from 10−2\n                     Hz to 106\n                     Hz using a precision impedance analyzer (Novocontrol Concept 80).']
