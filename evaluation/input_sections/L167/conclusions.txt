['The discrepancy of dielectric behaviors between the BT/PVDF and the BT/PI nanocomposite films was discovered. Although both of them have been loaded with the same volume fraction of BT nanoparticles, they do not show similar dielectric behaviors. In the BT/PVDF nanocomposite films, a significant increasing of dielectric permittivity at low frequency can be observed, but in the BT/PI ones, such a phenomenon fails to appear. On one hand, it can be found that size and crystal phases of BT nanoparticles affect the interfacial polarization in the nanocomposite films. On the other hand, the chain structure and polarity of polymer matrixes also play an essential role in the dielectric properties of nanocomposite films. Therefore, the size and crystal phases of nanoparticles would influence the dielectric properties of the polymer nanocomposite films, but the concrete consequents of effect on composites largely depends on the nature of the polymer matrix.']
