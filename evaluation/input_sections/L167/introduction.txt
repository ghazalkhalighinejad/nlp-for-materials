['Dielectric composites comprising of polymer matrix and inorganic particles have been widely studied due to the unique combination of their distinct dielectric properties and desirable processing ease. Such materials with high dielectric permittivity have opened opportunities for a myriad of applications, such as embedded capacitors, gate dielectrics, and electric energy storage devices [b0005 b0010 b0015 b0020]. Comparing with microsized particles, the nanoparticle-loaded composites possess a large interfacial area, dramatically promoting the exchange coupling effect through a interface layer and resulting in strong polarization and different dielectric responses [b0005 b0025]. Therefore, the research on dielectric properties of nanocomposites has been paid more attention in this field [b0030 b0035 b0040 b0045 b0050 b0055 b0060 b0065 b0070].', 'Previous state-of-the-art researches have confirmed that the size and crystal phases of inorganic nanoparticles played a crucial role in determining the dielectric behaviors of their nanocomposites [b0075 b0080]. The dielectric permittivities of BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles decrease with reducing diameter of particles as a result from the transformation in crystal phases of BT. Specifically, ferroelectric tetragonal BT (large diameter) has coupled with a permittivity as high as 1200 at room temperature, while cubic BT (small diameter) shows no ferroelectricity and a low permittivity [b0085]. The different physical properties of the BT nanoparticles supported that they have a remarkable effect on the final dielectric performances of the BT/polymer nanocomposites [b0090]. Moreover, such effect of nanoparticles on dielectric behavior would vary with polymer matrixes in the composites [b0095 b0100]. We have also reported the dielectric behaviors of PVDF-matrix nanocomposites loaded with different-size BT nanoparticles [b0075 b0090]. A significant increasing of dielectric permittivity at low frequency was observed. However, when the different-size BT nanoparticles were loaded into PI matrix, the dielectric permittivity of the BT/PI nanocomposite films failed to show such phenomena. The difference of polymer matrixes would be attributed to the remarkable discrepancy in the dielectric relaxations. Namely, the polarity of PVDF is much stronger than that of PI. Besides, PVDF is thermoplastic while PI is thermoset [b0070]. Such different chemical structures and chain interactions would have an effect on the polarization of dipoles and thus the behavior of charges in the materials under applied electric field. In light of multiple-region mode [b0100], the polarity and chain interactions of polymer matrix would influence the interface between particles and polymer matrix, consequently affecting the charge trapping and electron scattering at interface in the composites. Hence, the features of polymer matrixes also play an essential role in determining the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite films. Effect of the chemical structures of polymers, the size and morphology of fillers on dielectric performances is definitely necessary but has not yet been addressed to date. Therefore, in this study, we compared two kinds of BT/polymer nanocomposite films in order to discuss the collaborative effect of polymer matrices and nanoparticles on dielectric behaviors in wide range of frequency (10−2–106\n                     Hz).']
