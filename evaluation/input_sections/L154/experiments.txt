[['Materials', ['The MWCNTs used here were produced by thermal chemical vapor deposition of a xylene–ferrocene feedstock at 700°C in a quartz tube furnace [bib45]. The mean diameter of the MWCNTs was 31nm, with a relatively broad distribution [bib46]. Lexan 121 (General Electric) was chosen for the polymer matrix. Lexan 121 has a melt flow index of 17.5, tensile yield stress of 61MPa, and an elongation to break of 125%. The solvents tetrahydrofuran and methanol (analytical grade) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received.']], ['Preparation of nanotube/polycarbonate composites', ['MWCNT were either used as received (AR) or surface epoxide-modified (EP). The details of the surface modification of the MWCNT and its characterization are described elsewhere [bib28]. Briefly, the surface-modified nanotubes were oxidized and then reacted with a hydroxyl-terminated epoxide molecule. These covalently attached functional groups were then allowed to react with the polycarbonate matrix chains by transesterification [bib47 bib48] to cause tethering of polycarbonate chains onto the outer walls of the MWCNT.', 'MWCNT-reinforced PC samples were prepared by dispersing the MWCNTs in tetrahydrofuran by bath ultra-sonication in a water ice bath (Fisher Scientific FS60) for 3h. PC pellets were dried at 125°C for 2h, followed by dissolution in tetrahydrofuran. The MWCNT dispersion and the PC solution were then mixed together and ultra-sonicated for 1 more hour. The mixture was then dropped into stirred methanol causing precipitation of the composite material. The composite material was dried at 70°C under vacuum for 16h. To eliminate the risk of crystallization, dogbone samples were prepared using a DACA mini-injection molding machine. The barrel temperature was 205°C and the mold temperature was 140°C, and the injection pressure was 862kPa. The dimensions of the samples were 25.0mm×4.0mm×1.5mm (length×width×thickness). The composite samples prepared in this work contained AR-MWCNT concentrations of 2, 5 and 10wt%, and EP-MWCNT concentration of 5wt%. Pure PC samples were fabricated using an identical procedure as an experimental control.', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) verified that stress crystallization was not induced within the samples as noted by the absence of a melting endotherm. In addition, MWNTs were removed from the bulk polymer matrix via filtration through PTFE (100μm pore size) using THF as a solvent. After removal from the nanocomposite these MWNTs where still found to be coated by a polymer sheathing, at which time they were again analyzed by DSC to examine whether polymer crystallization was present at the MWNTs surface. No evidence of such crystalline polymer was detected, eliminating crystallinity as a cause of the behavior noted below.']], ['Characterization', ['Tensile tests of dog-bone shaped samples were conducted on an Instron 3042 equipped with an extensometer to record initial strains up to 10% during the runs. Samples were run at an extension rate of 0.5mm/min. Strains larger than 10% were determined based on the relative displacement of the crossheads of the Instron. At least 3–5 samples were tested for each material, with the average values for these tests reported here with error bars where appropriate.', 'Temperature and frequency dependent tests were completed on a Rheometrics DMTA-V in tensile mode. Sample dimensions were 8mm×3.2mm×1mm (length×width×thickness). Two distinct dynamic mechanical tests were done as described below. The first mode of testing consisted of temperature sweeps to measure the storage (<i>E</i>′) and loss (<i>E</i>″) moduli as a function of temperature. In these tests, the samples were subjected to a sinusoidal strain of 0.03% (to ensure linear viscoelastic behavior) at a frequency of 1Hz. The temperature scan rate for these tests was 2°C/min. The loss tangent (tan\n                        <i>δ</i>) curve is defined as the ratio of the loss modulus to the storage modulus. Finally, the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                        g) of each sample is defined here as the peak of the loss modulus curve as a function of temperature. For the second mode of testing, frequency sweeps at different temperatures were run from 0.2 to 200Hz at five frequencies per decade, evenly spaced in log frequency space. After each isotherm the temperature was raised and held constant for 5min before the subsequent test. These isothermal runs were conducted from 130 to 180°C. The applied sinusoidal strain for the frequency domain tests was again 0.03%. At least three samples of each type were tested. For clarity, only the most representative curve for each sample is shown; all tests showed consistent sample behavior.', 'The viscoelastic behavior of nanotube–polymer composites was characterized through the loss modulus and the relaxation spectra. These properties are directly related to changes in molecular mobility. For example, if there is a distinct region of altered mobility, the relaxation spectra and loss modulus response of the material will change relative to the viscoelastic response of the pure polymer; if this non-bulk polymer is characterized by reduced molecular mobility, peaks in the spectra and loss modulus will broaden towards higher frequencies and higher temperatures, respectively. If the entire polymer matrix has effectively been altered by interactions with the nanotube surface, the loss modulus and relaxation spectra will shift horizontally with respect to that of the pure polymer.', 'Details of the analysis for obtaining the relaxation spectra were described elsewhere [bib43 bib49]. Briefly, the storage (<i>E</i>′) and loss (<i>E</i>″) moduli can be expressed using a standard Prony series as a function of the frequency <i>ω</i>:\n                           \n

Based on the response at different temperatures over a relatively small frequency range (limited by the instrument range of the DMA), time-temperature superposition is used to obtain master curves for the storage and loss moduli at a particular reference temperature (150°C for this work). Based on this master reference curve at a single temperature, the experimental storage and loss moduli data were fit to a 30 term Prony representation such that the Prony coefficients <i>E</i>\n                        \n                           <i>j</i>\n                         were determined via a least-squares fitting procedure assuming relaxation times <i>τ</i>\n                        \n                           <i>j</i>\n                         evenly spaced and spanning the frequency range of the master reference curve [bib50].

In addition, probing of the nanocomposite fracture surface using a nanomanipulator operating within a scanning electron microscope [bib52] was conducted as described elsewhere [bib46].', 'Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the efficiency of load transfer to the nanotubes. MWCNT-polymer dog bone samples (both AR and EP-MWCNT) were pressed into ∼100μm films using a Carver double plate press at 205°C. The film was then glued on a dog-bone shaped substrate made of Ultem. A strain gauge was glued on the Ultem film for accurate measurement of the strain on the film. Polarized Raman spectroscopy (Reinshaw S2000) with 514nm excitation was used to monitor the position of the second order disorder peak as a function of the applied composite strain. The slope of this Raman peak position versus applied strain curve can be regarded as a measure of the load transfer efficiency in the composite, where a steeper slope corresponds to more efficient load transfer.', 'In addition, we used polarized Raman spectroscopy to measure the degree of MWNT alignment in the unstrained composites using procedures described by Gommans and co-workers [bib53]. With the polarizer and analyzer in parallel, the samples were rotated in 5° increments from 0° to 90° relative to the polarizer. Several points were measured on each sample, and the data from two samples was averaged. The measurements were done at 10mW and five accumulations of 10s to provide a peak with high signal to noise ratio. The normalized intensity values (against the maximum) were plotted against the angle of the sample. It was found that: 39% of the MWNT were in the range of 0–22.5°, 25% of the MWNTs were from 22.5° to 45°, 10% from 45° to 67.5° and 26% from 67.5° to 90°. Thus, while there was some processing-induced alignment due to the injection molding of the samples, the alignment was rather minimal and similar for all the composites tested. Thus, one can conclude that processing-induced alignment is not responsible for the interphase effects characterized in this paper.']]]
