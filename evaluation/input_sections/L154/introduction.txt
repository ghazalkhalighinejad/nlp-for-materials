['Carbon nanotubes are an intriguing reinforcement for polymers because of their unique mechanical properties and extremely large surface area per unit volume. Experiments [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5] and calculations [bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13] show that nanotubes have a modulus equal to or greater than the best graphite fibers, and strengths at least an order of magnitude higher than typical graphite fibers. For example, measurement of the tensile properties of individual multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) obtained values of 11–63GPa for the tensile strength and 270–950GPa for Young’s modulus [bib1]. For comparison, the modulus and strength of graphite fibers are 300–800 and 5GPa, respectively.', 'In addition to their outstanding mechanical properties, the surface area per unit volume of nanotubes is much larger than that of embedded graphite fibers. For example, 30nm diameter nanotubes have ∼150 times more surface area than 5μm diameter fibers for the same filler volume fraction, such that the nanotube/matrix interfacial area is much larger than that in traditional fiber-reinforced composites. As shown in [fig1]\n                     , this results in a much larger percentage of interphase (also called the interaction zone in the literature) in nanotube-reinforced polymers when the ratio of the thickness <i>t</i> of the interphase versus the inclusion radius <i>r</i>\n                     f is plotted with respect to the volume fraction of the inclusion. Polymer within this interphase region has a structure and properties altered from that of the bulk polymer matrix due to interactions with the embedded nanotubes. This interphase region is different in nature from the extensive work in the literature on fiber-reinforced composites describing engineered interfaces, where fiber sizings (of often negligible volume fraction) are purposefully introduced to enhanced the compatibility between the fibers and the polymer matrix (see the excellent review provided in [bib14]). In traditional fiber composites this interfacial region is critical to control the load transfer from the matrix to the fiber and thus critically influences both the modulus and fracture behavior of the composites [bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19]. However, due to the extreme surface area in nanotube-filled polymers the volume fraction of the interphase can be quite significant (in some instances even larger then that of the embedded nanotubes), suggesting an effective behavior more appropriately characterized as that of a three phase composite. While the polymer properties in the interphase are not well understood, it is clear that the mobility of the polymer is often altered in this region [bib20 bib21].', 'To predict the properties of nanotube-filled polymers, it is essential to understand the role of the nanotube–polymer interface with regards to both load transfer and the formation of the interphase region. Further, the realization of optimal effective mechanical properties for nanotube–polymer systems will likely be dependent on the ability to tailor both the interface and interphase within the material. Thus, a number of researchers are investigating both covalent and non-covalent surface modifications of the nanotubes to enhance the efficiency of load transfer to the nanotubes [bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28]. One particular challenge in this area is that the properties of the nanotube/polymer interface and of the polymer in the interaction zone are exceedingly difficult to measure experimentally. For example, while interfacial strength is often determined in traditional composites using single fiber pull-out tests and fragmentation tests [bib29 bib30], only recently have these techniques been successfully applied to nanotube/polymer interfaces [bib31]. Raman spectroscopy has also been used to measure load transfer from the matrix to the filler [bib32 bib33], but in the case of nano-fillers has only been applied for qualitative comparison [bib34]. The properties of the interphase are yet another challenge, although previous work has probed the influence of the local polymer environment on polymer chain mobility [bib35 bib36 bib37 bib38 bib39 bib40 bib41 bib42]. More recent work has addressed the change in polymer chain mobility within the interphase region of nanotube–polymer composites based on the effective viscoelastic behavior of macroscale samples, using micromechanical modeling techniques to study the local (nano-scale) properties of the interphase polymer [bib43 bib44]. Consistent with the results presented here, others have also suggested that changes in the non-bulk polymer behavior may provide an additional reinforcement mechanism in these systems; for example, nanopullout work has suggested that the interphase can withstand stresses that would otherwise cause considerable yield in the bulk polymer [bib31]. There have been few studies, however, that correlate the effect of the interface chemistry, the properties of the interphase polymer, and the macroscopic mechanical properties of the composite.', 'This paper presents a comprehensive study of the mechanisms of nanotube reinforcement as a function of interface chemistry for MWCNT–polycarbonate composites. In particular, both load transfer within the composite and non-bulk polymer interphase formation are characterized using Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. This study indicates that both an increase in load transfer efficiency and a larger non-bulk polymer interphase result from surface modification of the MWCNTs. The correlation between the macro-mechanical properties of MWCNT-filled composites and the molecular-level structure and behavior of the polymer chains presents new insights regarding the critical parameters influencing the mechanical behavior of these materials.']
