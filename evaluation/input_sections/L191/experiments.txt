[['Materials', ['Calcium carbonate nanoparticles with an average size of 44nm were supplied by Chengdu Nano Technology Group, China. Vinyl chloride monomer (VC) was provided by Wuhan Gedian Chemical Group Co. Ltd, China. The thermal stabilizer (XP-301) was a mixture of plumb salts. The processing aid (ACR-401) was an acrylate resin. They were provided by Zibo Plastics Chemical Co., China. Paraffin wax and stearic acid were industrial grade products commercially available.']], ['Synthesis of PVC/nanoCaCO3 compounded resins', ['The PVC/nanoCaCO3 compounded resins were synthesized by batch suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) in the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles. The reactor used consisted of a stainless steel jacket reaction vessel of 30l capacity fitted with four equally spaced stainless steel baffles. The agitator was a four-flat-blade turbine. The reaction mixture consisted of liquid VC as the dispersed phase and deionized water as the continuous phase. The reaction pressure and temperature were 3MPa and 54(±0.2)°C, respectively. Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVA) and hydroxyl propyl cellulose (HPMC) were used as suspension agents. The initiator used was a mixture of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and 2-ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate (EHP). After the conversion of VC reached 85%, the polymerization was stopped, and the PVC/nanoCaCO3 compounded resins obtained had an average particle size of 150μm containing 0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5wt% of CaCO3 nanoparticles. Based on gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, the average molecular weights and molecular distribution indexes of PVC macromolecules in pristine PVC resin and PVC/nanoCaCO3 compounded resins are roughly 81,250-82,180 and 2.45-2.50, respectively. Obviously, the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles does not affect the polymerization of VC.']], ['Preparation of PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites', ['The compositions of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites are: 100 parts PVC/nanoCaCO3 compounded resins, 7 parts XP-301, 2 parts ACR-401, 0.6 part paraffin wax (intermediate lubricant), and 0.8 part stearic acid. The above mixtures were mixed in a high-speed mixer, and then plasticized by a two-roll mill at 180°C for 10min. Composite plates with dimensions 200×80×3.2mm3 were compression molded at 175°C for 8min, with a 5min preheating period. Care was taken at this stage to ensure precise timing in order to eliminate any differences that might arise caused by the samples having different thermal histories. These plates were cut to dog-bone shaped tensile bars. Charpy notched impact specimens were also cut from the compression molded plates.']], ['Morphology observations', ['Specimens of PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were ultramicrotomed to give 60nm-thick sections with a diamond knife under a liquid nitrogen environment using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome. Sections were collected on 300 mesh copper TEM grids and subsequently dried with filter paper, and examined by a Hitachi-800 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 22kV.', 'The morphologies of the fracture surfaces of all composites were observed in a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 820). The specimens were coated with a thin layer of gold prior to SEM examination.']], ['Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)', ['Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted with a TA2980 Instrument dynamic mechanical analyser at a fixed frequency of 10Hz and oscillation amplitude of 0.15mm. The temperature range studied was from −20 to 130°C with a heating rate of 1°C/min.']], ['Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)', ['The thermal degradation characteristics of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites were carried out using a Seiko thermogravimetric analyser (model SSC/5200). The weight loss against temperature was measured at a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 in a helium environment from 50 to 400°C.']], ['Rheological measurements', ['Rheological properties of PVC and PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites were measured using a capillary rheometer (model XLY-1) at 175°C. The capillary die used had a length (L) to diameter (D) ratio of 40/1 and an entrance angle of 180°. The Rabinowitch and Bagley corrections [bib29] were applied to all the experimental data.']], ['Mechanical characterization', ['Tensile properties were determined with an Instron tester (model 4206) at a crosshead rate of 5mm/min. Charpy notched impact samples with dimensions 65×13×3.2mm3 were also tested by a Ceast pendulum impact tester. A blunt notch with a notch tip radius of 0.25mm was introduced to the impact specimens with a CEAST notch opener. The impact speed was set to 2m/s. All mechanical tests were conducted at ambient temperature (20–25°C) and the average value of five repeated tests was taken for each composition.']]]
