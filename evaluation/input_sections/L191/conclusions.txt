["Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanocomposites were synthesized by in situ polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) in the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles. The results showed that CaCO3 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the PVC matrix. The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     g) and 5% weight loss temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     5%) of PVC phases in the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites were slightly higher compared to pristine PVC due to the restriction of CaCO3 nanoparticles on the segmental and long-range chain mobility of the PVC phase. The nanocomposites all exhibit shear thinning and power law behaviors. At low shear rates (<100s−1), the apparent viscosity of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites is higher than that of pristine PVC at 2.5wt% CaCO3 nanoparticles, then it decreases with increasing nanoparticle loading. At high shear rates (>100s−1), the apparent viscosity of the nanocomposites is lower than that of pristine PVC, and decreases with increasing CaCO3 nanoparticles loading due to the ball bearing effect of spherical nanoparticles. The viscosity sensitivity on shear rate is higher for nanocomposites than pristine PVC. But as the CaCO3 nanoparticles excceds 5.0wt%, the shear rate sensitivity of the nanocomposite melts is decreased due to agglomeration of the CaCO3 nanoparticles in the PVC matrix. The mechanical properties of the PVC/CaCO3 nanocomposites indicate that CaCO3 nanoparticles stiffen and toughen PVC. At 5wt% nanoparticles, optimal properties were obtained in Young's modulus, tensile yield strength, elongation-at-break and Charpy notched impact energy. Detailed examinations of failure mechanisms of impact and tensile specimens showed that CaCO3 nanoparticles acted as stress concentrators leading to interface debonding/voiding and matrix deformation. These mechanisms lead to impact toughening of the nanocomposites."]
