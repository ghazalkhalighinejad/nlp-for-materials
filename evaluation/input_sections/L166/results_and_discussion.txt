[['Surface chemistry of GNPs', ['[f0005]\n                        (a) illustrated that after the oxidation and ultrasonication, the graphite flakes completely exfoliated into very thin platelets, forming oxygen-containing GNPs. As shown in [f0005](b), the D band of GNPs becomes stronger and broader, suggesting a higher level of disorder of the graphene layers and defects introduced during the functionalization process. The ratio of the intensities (<i>I</i>\n                        D/<i>I</i>\n                        G) for GNP was slightly increased, indicating the formation of some sp3 carbon after acid oxidation. The XPS results in [f0005](c) showed that the initial oxygen concentration on graphite was only a small proportion of 5.68%, but after oxidation and ultrasonication, it drastically increased to 27.15% along with the reduction in carbon content. High-resolution core-level C 1s spectra for GNPs was present in [f0005](d), and this band indicated that a considerable degree of oxidation with four major signatures corresponding to carbon atoms in different functional groups. The generation of oxygen functional groups, such as epoxide, hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl groups would render the GNPs somewhat hydrophilic and better compatibility with polymer matrix. After ultrasonic treatment, the expanded graphite worms were fragmented into GNPs with the thickness of 20–50nm, as shown by [f0005](e).']], ['Morphology of GNP/epoxy composites', ['For the purpose of interface region designing, the controllable formation of oxygenic functional groups on the basal planes of GNPs was considered to be a critical issue. In order to realize the functionalization, the intercalated graphite flake was treated by thermal shock and ultrasonication. During the curing process of epoxy matrix, strong interfacial adhesion and chemical reaction were speculated to occur between functionalized GNPs and epoxy molecular chains, as illustrated in [f0010]\n                        .', 'As revealed in [f0015]\n                        , isolated GNPs were homogeneously dispersed in epoxy matrix and almost no large agglomerates or bundles were observed. The strong interfacial adhesion between oxygenic groups on the basal planes of GNPs and epoxy molecular chains led to high embedding and tight binding of GNPs in the matrix. For this reason, these wrinkled and isolated GNPs effectively prevents direct contact between graphite nanoparticles in the composite, which give advantages for forming a large microcapacitor network and suppressing the leakage current.']], ['Dielectric properties of GNP/epoxy composites', ['The variations of the dielectric properties with increased frequency ranging from 102 to 106\n                        Hz for pure epoxy and GNP/epoxy composites are shown in [f0020]\n                        . At a lower frequency range (102–104\n                        Hz), the dielectric constant of GNP/epoxy composite improved dramatically, and up to higher than 230 when the filler content was 1.892vol.%. Moreover, this value still remained at more than 100 even in the frequency of 106\n                        Hz. It was notable that at the filler content of 0.949vol.%, the dielectric constant of the composite was almost frequency independent and reached above 60 over the frequency range of 102–105\n                        Hz. The loss tangent of the composite, however, kept values lower than 0.3 around 104\n                        Hz, which indicated a promising composite with high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. As mentioned in the percolation theory, both the dielectric constant and loss tangent exhibit a transition behavior in the vicinity of percolation threshold. Thus, considerably high loss tangent of the composites with higher volume fraction of GNPs could be observed in [f0020](b). Normally, the conductivity of GNP/epoxy composites originated two mechanism: (1) Ohmic conduction (frequency independent), through direct contact of GNPs, and (2) non-Ohmic conduction (frequency dependent), through the barrier-tunneling effect between GNPs separated by an epoxy layer. As revealed in [f0020](c), the percolation transition can be considered as the transition from non-Ohmic conduction to Ohmic conduction. When the filler content exceed a critical value (higher than 1.351vol.%), the variation of ac conductivities of the composites are frequency independent when the external field frequency is lower than 1kHz. With further increase of external filed frequency, the dipoles and charge carriers have less time to orient in the direction of the alternating field and the conduction mechanism comes back to the non-Ohmic conduction through tunneling effect. Therefore, the percolation threshold need to be calculated in the frequency range that the insulator-to-conductor transition occurs. According to the literature [b0130 b0135 b0140 b0145], the ac conductivities of the composites at 100 and 1kHz were the mostly used data to calculate the percolation threshold. However, due to the large leakage current in the GNP/epoxy composites at lower frequency (i.e., at 100Hz), we had to choose the latter frequency of 1kHz. The ac conductivity σ of the GNP/epoxy composites near the percolation threshold can be predicted by power law as follows:\n                           \n                              \n                                 σ\n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       GNPs\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                                 ∝\n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       c\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 -\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       GNPs\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       )\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       -\n                                       s\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                 for\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       GNPs\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 ⩽\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       c\n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>f</i>\n                        c is the percolation threshold, <i>f</i>\n                        GNPs is the volume fraction of GNPs, and <i>s</i> is the critical exponents. The best fit of the experimental ac conductivity values to the plot of power laws give <i>f</i>\n                        c\n                        =1.51vol.% and <i>s</i>\n                        =1.36, and the critical exponent value is close to the value of PVDF/exfoliated graphite nanosheets [b0150]. Besides, it is notable that a high dielectric constant of more than 230 and a high thermal conductivity of 0.54W/mK could be achieved simultaneously for the composite with the GNPs content of 1.892vol.%.', 'The significant increase of dielectric constant can be mainly attributed to the interfacial polarization in heterogeneous epoxy system filled with GNPs and to the mini-capacitor principle. The former phenomenon is known as the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) mechanism which is caused by the large difference in dielectric constant between the polymer matrix and the fillers [b0130 b0135]. A large increase in permittivity is observed at the percolation limit as in the case of electrical conductivity. The mini-capacitor principle can be invoked as being responsible for such increment [b0155]. With increase of GNPs content in polymer phase, the isolation distances between neighboring GNPs are continuously reduced. Finally, a network of mini-capacitors with the GNPs as electrodes and a very thin epoxy layer in between as dielectric can be formed in the composite near percolation threshold. Each mini-capacitor contributes an abnormally large capacitance, which can then correlate with the significant increase in the dielectric permittivity. At the percolation point, conductive paths are limited and the contribution of mini-capacitors to the conductivity is of large importance and becomes dominant after a critical frequency. Furthermore, a thin insulating layer of epoxy is combined with the GNPs to form a nanoscale structure in the composites, which can fully realized the advantages of GNPs (i.e., large specific surface area) and result in a huge interfacial area between GNPs and polymer in the nanocomposite, which in turn provides numerous sites for the reinforced MWS effect. As can be seen in the calculation of critical exponent, the value of s is higher than universal ones (<i>s</i>\n                        =0.8–1) were explained by unusual models, such as the inverse Swiss-cheese model. The inverse Swiss-cheese model, which is based on a medium made of conducting particles embedded in an insulating matrix, where the conduction process is controlled by inter-particle tunneling. This in turn proves that the large increase of dielectric constant is mainly attributed to the formation of mini-capacitors in the composite. Besides, inhomogeneous composites were found to show better dielectric properties than the homogeneous composites [b0160 b0165]. Therefore, the inhomogeneous nature may be another reason for the large deviation of dielectric constant from the Maxwell relation. In our study, the GNPs obtained from thermal shock and ultrasonication may have different thicknesses and aspect ratios, which can lead to inhomogeneity. Thus, the fillers are not well dispersed, but rather stay touching other platelets forming interfaces between GNPs. The interface dipoles associated with GNP/GNP interfaces are thus apparently responsible for the increased permittivity. These interface dipole moments are thought to arise from the electronic that are trapped at the GNP/GNP interface electronic states, and the energy levels of these states are different from those of GNP/epoxy interface states.', 'The multi-core model of the interface has been prominent in a number of contributions concerning the dielectric behavior of composites [b0065 b0170 b0175], and the effective dielectric constant of the composite may be influenced through the variation of any of the interface characteristics [b0065 b0110 b0115]. Since the chemical structure of the interface region is a function of the polymer and its interaction with the surface of the filler particles, changes of the bonding situation between these two phases will alter the effective dielectric constant of the composite [b0100 b0180 b0185 b0190 b0195]. Therefore, the controlling of aspect ratio and surface chemistry of GNPs could be an effective way to realizing the interface designing, thereby achieving the composites with both high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity. In this research, large diffusion cloud and out of phase dipole movement offered an explanation of the unusual high permittivity of GNP/epoxy composites at lower frequency range. With further increasing frequency of applied field, the diffusion cloud lessened and with it the out of phase dipole movement. Meanwhile, when the filler concentration was sufficiently high, it would be possible for the diffusion clouds and ultimately the double layers to overlap, which give the explanation of large leakage current within the composites. Referred in the multi-core model, the structures of the second and third layers were presumed crucial in characterizing physical performances. Due to the high aspect ratio and multi-layered structure of GNPs, charges could easily diffuse through the inside graphene layers of GNPs, which functioned as highly conductive channels in the first layer. Besides, the oxygenic groups on the basal planes of GNPs afford sufficient covalent and non-covalent bonds with epoxy matrix molecule chains in the second and third layer, which decrease the carrier traps and increase the hole mobility. Coupling with the high conductivity of GNPs, the collaborative effects of multi-layers in the interface region brought about the composites with high dielectric constant even at very low filler content. Thus, the strategy of interface design is feasible in our research. [f0025]\n                         illustrates the multi-core model of the interface region of GNP/epoxy composites.']], ['Thermal properties of GNP/epoxy composites', ['As expected, the thermal conductivities of the polymeric composites were strongly dependent on the GNPs content, with higher volume fractions consistently resulting in higher thermal conductivities of the composites, shown in [f0030]\n                        . When the filler content was 2.703vol.%, the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resin achieved 0.72W/mK a 2.4-fold improvement, which showed large advantages comparing to that of composites filled with AlN, Si3N4 and copper particles [b0055 b0060 b0200]. Meanwhile, with the incorporation of 2.703vol.% GNPs, the dielectric constant of the composites was higher than 140 at 102–104\n                        Hz, accompanied by considerably dielectric loss.', 'Recently, it was found that fillers with high aspect ratio, such as whiskers and platelets, can form more continuous thermally conductive pathways in the polymer matrix and thus are more effective in enhancing the thermal transfer [b0205]. Combined with the high intrinsic thermal conductivity of GNPs, these offered reasonable explanations for the larger increment of thermal conductivity of GNP/epoxy composites with increasing filler content than traditional thermally conductive fillers. It has been acknowledged that the thermal conductivity of polymeric composite is mechanistically limited by the polymer-filler interfacial thermal resistance, resulting from the presence of a weak interfacial interaction between soft epoxy layer and rigid GNP hinders the phonon transport [b0210 b0215 b0220]. With the oxygenic groups on the basal planes of GNPs, a homogeneous GNP network in the epoxy matrix could be achieved under relatively higher filler content, as also can be seen in the SEM fractographs of the composite. Thus the thinner polymer layers on the surface would decrease the scattering for the phonon transfer and promote the diffusion of phonons in the overall composites, which has been proved in the polymeric systems filled with carbon nanotubes or GNP/carbon nanotubes [b0225 b0230 b0235 b0240]. Surface modification of the particles had already been proved to be a wide applicable technique to prevent from the filler aggregation and enhance particle-matrix interfacial interaction, and enhanced interfacial adhesion by chemical bonding is an effective way to decrease interfacial thermal resistance [b0245 b0250 b0255]. The short and rigid interfacial bonding (covalent bonds) can cause significant reduction of the acoustic impendance mismatch and minimization of interfacial phonon scattering in the overall composites [b0285 b0290]. In GNPs, the inside graphene layers functioned as highly conductive channels for thermal transport, while the chemically functionalized outside layers could afford sufficient covalent and non-covalent bonding with the matrix molecule chains, and facilitated the phonon transfer from the graphene oxide to the polymer matrix [b0025]. With the oxygenic groups on the surface of GNPs, the covalent bridge bonds between GNPs and epoxy molecular chains minimized the interfacial phonon scattering and decreased the interface heat resistance by interpenetrating particles-resin interface. Considering the multi-core model, the functional groups reacting with the epoxy molecule during the curing process built up the first layer though covalent bonds, which facilitate the phonon transportation. In addition, a collaborative effect among fillers through the second and third layer would work for better thermal conductivity, either, which had been illustrated in silica-polyimide composites [b0295].', 'Agari’s semi-empirical model is based on the generalization of series and parallel conduction models in the composite and correlates thermal conductivity with the ability of fillers to create particle conductive chains. The logarithmic equation of Agari is [b0275]:\n                           \n                              \n                                 log\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       c\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 =\n                                 φ\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       C\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       2\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 log\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 +\n                                 (\n                                 1\n                                 -\n                                 φ\n                                 )\n                                 log\n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       C\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       1\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       p\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>k</i>\n                        c, <i>k</i>\n                        p and <i>k</i>\n                        f are respectively the thermal conductivity of the composite, of the polymer matrix and of the fillers. <i>φ</i> is the filler volume fraction, and <i>C</i>\n                        1 and <i>C</i>\n                        2 are obtained by fitting experimental data. A logarithmic plot of thermal conductivity values as a function of the filler volume concentration is presented in the inset graph of [f0030], and the two parameters <i>C</i>\n                        1 and <i>C</i>\n                        2 were calculated to be 0.73 and −0.186. The value of 0.73 for <i>C</i>\n                        1 suggested that the GNPs with abundant functional groups could affect the curing process of epoxy resin chains and decrease the cross-linking degree of the matrix. The low value of <i>C</i>\n                        2 suggested that the GNPs have strong ability to create continuous thermal conductive chains, and the formation of conductive network becomes much easier with the incorporation of GNPs. As mentioned in recent results, when the size of fillers decreases from micro-scale to nano-scale, the <i>C</i>\n                        2 value might have a negative value representing the overwhelming ability of GNPs to create continuous chains [b0060]. Besides, Agari and his co-workers assumed that there is a relationship between <i>C</i>\n                        2 parameter obtained from the fitting of thermal conductivity data and the concentration at electrical percolation threshold when the polymeric matrix is filled with metallic particles. This assumption is possible if the crystallinity of the polymer does not change in the presence of filler particles. In this case, the Agari’s model becomes:\n                           \n                              \n                                 log\n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       c\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 /\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       p\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                                 =\n                                 φ\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       C\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       2\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 log\n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 /\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       k\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       p\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )', 'Finally, Agari et al. showed that <i>C</i>\n                        2 remains a curve fitting parameter that can be used to determine the electrical percolation threshold using:\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       C\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       2\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 =\n                                 log\n                                 (\n                                 1\n                                 /\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       φ\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       c\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>φ</i>\n                        c is determined as the volume concentration at the inflection point in the electrical resistivity versus filler concentration curve, i.e. concentration of electrical percolation. When <i>C</i>\n                        1 is defined as unity and <i>C</i>\n                        2 values from linear fitting of thermal conductivity of the composites (<i>C</i>\n                        2\n                        =−0.186), the value of <i>φ</i>\n                        c is calculated to 1.53vol.%. According to the analysis of dielectric properties, the percolation threshold of the GNP/epoxy composites was found to be 1.51vol.%. Besides, one important assumption is that the crystallinity of the polymer does not change in the presence of filler particles. The GNPs took part in the curing process of epoxy resin and caused a lower <i>C</i>\n                        1 value, which resulted in a higher <i>C</i>\n                        2 value and lower <i>φ</i>\n                        c value. Thus, the percolation threshold calculated from linear fitting of thermal conductivity showed accordance with that of dielectric experiment data.']]]
