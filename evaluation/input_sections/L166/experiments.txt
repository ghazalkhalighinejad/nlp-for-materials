[['Preparation of GNPs', ['Natural crystalline graphite flakes (80 mesh, Kuntai Graphite Co. Ltd., China) were intercalated by acid treatment (sulfuric acid and acetic acid). After thermal shock, the graphite was added into the acetone bath and sonicated in the ultrasonic equipment for exfoliation, and then the very thin GNPs were obtained in acetone solvent.']], ['Preparation of GNP/epoxy composites', ['After heating the bisphenol type epoxy resin (D.E.R.331, DOW Chemicals) to 60°C, the curing agent (methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride, MTHPA, DOW Chemicals) and GNP-acetone mixture were added into the epoxy resin under ultrasonication and continuously stirring for 1h to obtain a uniform dispersion. Then the mixed epoxy system containing a certain content of accelerator (2,4,6-tri(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol, DMP-30, DOW Chemicals) was poured into a preheated mold at 90°C and cured with standard procedure. The weight ratios of epoxy, curing agent and accelerator were 100, 70, and 1, respectively. The volume contents of GNPs were employed in the range from 0.270 to 2.703vol.%.']], ['Characterization', ['The GNPs and fracture morphology of GNP/epoxy composites were examined using JSM 7000F scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal conductive properties of the composites were measured with Netzsch LFA 457 Laser Flash Apparatus. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was acquired on a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM, T6400) was used to characterize the GNPs.']]]
