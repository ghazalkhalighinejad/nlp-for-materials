A graphite nanoplatelet/epoxy composite with high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity
A simple strategy for the preparation of composites with high dielectric constant and thermal conductivity was developed through a typical interface design. Graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) with a thickness of 20–50nm are fabricated and homogeneously dispersed in the epoxy matrix. A high dielectric constant of more than 230 and a high thermal conductivity of 0.54W/mK (a 157% increase over that of pure epoxy) could be obtained for the composites with a lower filler content of 1.892vol.%. The dielectric constant still remains at more than 100 even in the frequency range of 105–106
                     Hz. When loaded at 2.703vol.%, GNP/epoxy composites have a dielectric constant higher than 140 in the frequency range of 102–104
                     Hz and a high thermal conductivity of 0.72W/mK, which is a 240% increase over that of pure epoxy. The high dielectric constant and low loss tangent are observed in the composite with the GNPs content of 0.949vol.% around 104
                     Hz. It is believed that high aspect ratio of GNPs and oxygen functional groups on their basal planes are critical issues of the constitution of a special interface region between the GNPs and epoxy matrix and the high performance of the composites.
