Dielectric properties of Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/CaCu3Ti4O12 composites
The possibility of obtaining relatively high dielectric constant polymer–ceramic composite by incorporating the giant dielectric constant material, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) in a Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer matrix by melt mixing and hot pressing process was demonstrated. The structure, morphology and dielectric properties of the composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Thermal analysis, scanning electron microscope, and impedance analyzer. The effective dielectric constant (<i>ε</i>
                     eff) of the composite increased with increase in the volume fraction of CCTO at all the frequencies (100Hz–1MHz) under study. The dielectric loss did not show any variation up to 40% loading of CCTO, but showed an increasing trend beyond 40%. The room temperature dielectric constant as high as 95 at 100Hz has been realized for the composite with 55vol.% of CCTO, which has increased to about 190 at 150°C. Theoretical models like Maxwell’s, Clausius–Mossotti, Effective medium theory, logarithmic law and Yamada were employed to rationalize the dielectric behaviour of the composite and discussed.
