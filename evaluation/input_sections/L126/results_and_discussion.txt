['[fig1]\n                     a–d shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns obtained for the starting powders (for synthesizing CCTO) calcined at 950°C and 1000°C, for different durations. Bragg peaks corresponding to the unreacted phases are noticed in the pattern even after 10h of calcination at 950°C ([fig1]c). Hence the processing temperature has been increased to 1000°C. Phase-pure CCTO could be obtained by calcining the powders at 1000°C/10h ([fig1]d). The CCTO crystallites were found to be in the 1–7μm range. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the as received PVDF and the hot-pressed composites (PVDF+55vol.% CCTO) are shown in [fig2]\n                      respectively. It is evident from these patterns that the PVDF ([fig2]a) exists in mixed phases of α and γ which are non-polar. The sharp peaks at 2<i>θ</i> corresponding to 17.7° (100), 18.4° (020), 19.9° (110) and 35.7° (200) are assigned to the α-PVDF [bib6 bib10 bib11]. The broad peak at 2<i>θ</i>\n                     =26.8° (022) and 38.7° (211) could be indexed to the γ-phase of PVDF [bib37]. The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained for PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite ([fig2]b), shows the predominance of CCTO phase. The intensities of the peaks pertaining to the PVDF are not significant. This is due to the presence of higher weight percent of CCTO than that of PVDF in the PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite.', 'The thermo gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out to study the thermal stability of the polymer and the composites. [fig3]\n                      shows the thermograms recorded for the pure PVDF and the composites. It is observed that the pure PVDF is stable up to 390°C and complete degradation of the polymer occurred at around 500°C. But the composites exhibited better stability than that of the pure polymer. As seen in the thermogram, complete degradation of the composites does not taken place as observed in the case of pure PVDF. The composites exhibit ([fig3]b–e) unique decomposition behaviour which is attributed to the presence of CCTO in PVDF. The weight loss obtained from the burnt (950°C/24h) out test on a few composite samples by the gravimetric determination is in good agreement with the experimental values.', 'The SEM micrographs of the hot-pressed as prepared composites containing various volume percent of CCTO filler are shown in [fig4]\n                     a–c. It is seen that the CCTO particle distribution is homogeneous with small trails of agglomeration associated with a smooth surface finish with minimum porosity. These results indicate that the CCTO is evenly distributed in the PVDF matrix. As reported earlier [bib38], good dispersion along with homogeneous packing of ceramic filler is likely to exhibit high dielectric constant. Indeed, we could achieve a dielectric constant as high as 95 at 100Hz eventhough the distribution of the ceramic fillers are heterogeneous for the PVDF with 55vol.% CCTO composite.', 'The processing of such composites is much easier and could be made into a variety of shapes. The properties of such phase systems are governed by the number of factors: volume fraction of the dispersing phases, their properties and the way in which these different phases are interconnected [bib1]. The PVDF/ceramic composites are expected to show complex dielectric behaviour due to the different polymorphisms of PVDF.', '[fig5]\n                      presents the variation of dielectric constant and loss with frequency for the CCTO ceramic sintered at 1100/2h. The dielectric constant decreases as the frequency increases and at 10kHz, the dielectric constant and the loss is 2500 and 0.04 respectively. The frequency dependence of the dielectric constant of the composite with different CCTO contents are shown in [fig6]\n                     . As expected, the effective dielectric constant (<i>ε</i>\n                     eff) increases with increase in CCTO content in PVDF at all the frequencies under study. In all the cases, the effective dielectric constants obtained are higher than that of pure PVDF, but much lower than that of pure CCTO. The low frequency dispersion increases with increase in the CCTO content. The reason for increased low frequency dispersion may be due to the space charge effects and high dielectric loss associated with CCTO. It is well known that PVDF has five different polymorphisms; of which four phases designated as α, β, γ and δ are stable at room temperature. The α-phase is the most commonly present. The low dielectric constant as compared to that of CCTO observed for the PVDF/CCTO composite may be due to the following facts apart from the connectivity and particle size effects. Based on X-ray studies, it is confirmed that the PVDF is present in the mixed phases of α and γ which are non-polar. Due to the non-polar nature of PVDF, and the constrained polymer chain hindering the contribution of electrical polarization, the value of <i>ε</i>r\n                      is lower than that of CCTO.', 'The frequency dependence of the dielectric loss of PVDF/CCTO composite with different volume percent of CCTO are shown in [fig7]\n                     . The loss undergoes two relaxations; one in the low frequency region and the other at high frequencies. The relaxation beyond 1MHz is related to the glass transition relaxation of PVDF and is denoted as <i>α</i>a\n                      relaxation [bib39 bib40 bib41]. Similarly, the relaxation peak that appears below 100Hz could be attributed to <i>α</i>a\n                      relaxation associated with molecular motion in the crystalline regions of PVDF [bib41]. It is observed that ([fig7]) the dielectric loss decreases in the 100Hz to ∼10kHz frequency range and then subsequently increases up to a frequency (1MHz) that is covered in the present study. There is no appreciable change in the loss behaviour up to the 40% of ceramic loading and then the loss increases especially at low frequencies when the ceramic loading is increased to 55% in the composite which is ascribed to the presence of CCTO particles in PVDF. It is believed that up to 40% of ceramic loading, the uniform distribution of CCTO particles (as revealed by the scanning electron microscopy) in the immobile matrix, hinders the formation of networks and results in a decrease in the dielectric loss in the composite. However, at higher contents of CCTO, as seen in [fig4]c there is a well established connectivity which resulted in an increase in the dielectric loss.', '[fig8 fig9]\n                     \n                      illustrate the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss of PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite at different temperatures (50–150°C) respectively. The dielectric constant increases with increasing temperature ([fig8]). The room temperature dielectric constant is 95 at 100Hz, which has increased to about 190 at 150°C (100Hz). But the rise in dielectric constant with rise in temperature decreases with increase in frequency as shown in [fig8]. There is no significant change in the dielectric constant in the 100kHz–1MHz frequency range even at 150°C. These results are consistent with the fact that the dielectric constant of CCTO is nearly independent of frequency (up to 1MHz) and has low thermal coefficient of permittivity (TCK) over a wider range of temperatures (100–600K) [bib27 bib28]. The dielectric loss ([fig9]) also increases as the temperature increases and decreases as the frequency increases which is also consistent with that of the CCTO behaviour.', 'In the present work, various models are used in order to predict the effective dielectric constant of the composite. [fig10]\n                      shows the room temperature dielectric constant of the composite at 10kHz (experimental) for different volume fractions of CCTO. For comparison, the dielectric constant calculated based on various models [bib42 bib43 bib44 bib45 bib46] are also included in the same figure. The dielectric property of a diphasic dielectric mixture comprising of spherical crystallites with high dielectric constant dispersed in a matrix of low dielectric constant could be well described by Maxwell’s model [bib42].

volume fraction of the ceramic dispersed, <i>ɛ</i>c\n                     , <i>ɛ</i>p\n                      and <i>n</i> are the dielectric constants of the particle, polymer and the ceramic morphology fitting factor respectively. The small value of <i>n</i> indicates the filler particles to be in near-spherical shape, while a high value of <i>n</i> indicates largely non-spherically shaped particles. In the low volume fraction regime, the <i>ε</i>\n                     eff value for <i>f</i>\n                     CCTO\n                     =0.2 is 20.4, which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i>\n                     eff (24.7). The ceramic particle size has been proven to influence the effective dielectric constant in the composite and the size of the CCTO particle used in this work is around 1–7μm range. Though this model is suitable for the ceramic particles less than 1μm and also depends on their morphology, interestingly, the experimental value fits well into the EMT model [bib45] with the shape parameter <i>n</i>\n                     =0.11. The difference between the experimental data and the predicted value is less than 10% in the higher volume fraction regime (up to 55vol.%) ([fig10]). It is to be noted that the morphology fitting factor obtained from the fit (<i>n</i>\n                     =0.11) is closer to that of reported (<i>n</i>\n                     =0.13) [bib45]. The theoretical morphology fitting factor is closer to that of the experimental one, and is consistent with that observed (irregular shaped particles) in the present studies ([fig4]a–c) [bib45]. Therefore, the close agreement that is found between the experimental and theoretical values is attributed to the morphology of the dispersed particles.', 'The model that was developed by Yamada et al. [bib46], is used to predict <i>ε</i>\n                     eff.

and <i>ε</i>\n                     2 are, respectively, the dielectric constant of the epoxy and CCTO ceramics, “<i>n</i>” is the parameter related to the geometry of the ceramic particles and ƒCCTO is the volume fraction of the CCTO phase in the matrix. The parameter “<i>n</i>” was evaluated to fit the theoretical value obtained from Eq. [fd1] to the observed values. Here, in the higher volume fraction regime, the experimental results are comparable to those obtained using this model, when the parameter “<i>n</i>” is around 9.3 ([fig10]). The <i>ε</i>\n                     eff value for <i>f</i>\n                     CCTO\n                     =0.4 is 43.7 which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i>\n                     eff (48.2). Similarly, the <i>ε</i>\n                     eff value for <i>f</i>\n                     CCTO\n                     =0.55 is 74 which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i>\n                     eff (69.4). Here again, it is observed that the “<i>n</i>” parameter is related to the geometry of the particles, and the “<i>n</i>” parameter of 9.3 obtained from the fit is correlated to the irregular geometry of the ceramic particles as mentioned above. The particles geometry in turn effect the connectivity and hence the observed effective dielectric constant in the composite. These observations clearly demonstrate the effective applicability of this model to rationalize the dielectric characteristics of the present composite at higher filler content.', 'Mostly, in the polymer–ceramic composite systems, the ceramic is in the powder form instead of sintered form. The dielectric constant of the ceramic in the sintered form is much higher than that of the un sintered one. The PVDF–CCTO composite in this work deals with the composite of medium composed of dispersed unsintered CCTO powder within the polymer. Hence, at higher volume fraction, the experimental results are comparable to those obtained using the EMT and Yamada models.', 'The effective dielectric constant of polymer/filler composite material is dependent not only on the dielectric constants of the polymer and the filler, size and shape of the filler and the volume fraction of the filler, but also on the dielectric constant of the interphase region, volume of the interphase region and on the type of coupling agents [bib47 bib48 bib49 bib50]. One cannot afford to ignore these aspects for fabricating composites with improved dielectric properties.']
