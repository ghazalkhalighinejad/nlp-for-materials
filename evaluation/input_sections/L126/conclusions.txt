['Composites of CCTO /PVDF with CCTO content ranging from 0% to 55% by volume were fabricated and characterized. The flexibility of the composite could be retained when the ceramic loading was up to 30vol.%. As expected, the effective dielectric constant (<i>ε</i>\n                     eff) and dielectric loss increases with increase in the volume fraction of CCTO at all frequencies under study. Dielectric constant as high as 95 at 100Hz was achieved. Though the dielectric constant increases with increasing temperature, the rise in dielectric constant with rise in temperature is not significant at frequencies from 10kHz to 1MHz. The SEM of the composites revealed the excellent distribution of CCTO fillers in PVDF matrix.', 'Among the various models used for rationalizing the dielectric behaviour, experimental <i>ε</i>\n                     eff at higher volume fractions regime is comparable with those obtained with the models like EMT (<i>n</i>\n                     =0.11) and Yamada (<i>n</i>\n                     =9.3) and the difference between the experimental data and the predicted value is less than 10%.', 'However, all these models have the limitations that interfacial structure and chemistry in a composite have not been taken into account. Since the microstructure and microchemistry of interfaces often controls the mechanical, physical and electrical properties of composite materials, incorporating interfacial effect, the dielectric behaviour of CCTO/PVDF composite needs to be studied in detail. The CCTO/PVDF composite in this study have further scope of fabricating modified composites with treatment of coupling agent with CCTO, for its interfacial structural properties.']
