['Electronic systems in general consist of both the active and passive components. The technologies concerning the development of the passive components such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors are steadily growing in the electronic industries. Among these passive components, the capacitor is the one which attracts special attention due to its variety of functions that include decoupling, by-passing, filtering and timing capacitors. In recent years much work has been done on polymer–ceramic composites. Owing to the continuous development towards the miniaturization of electronics, high dielectric constant polymer–ceramic composites have become promising materials for embedded capacitor applications.', 'Ferroelectric ceramics possessing very high dielectric constants are brittle and suffer from poor mechanical strength. On the other hand, polymers having low dielectric constants in the range of 2–5 traditionally used in low leakage capacitors are flexible, easy to process and possess high dielectric strength. New composites associated with high dielectric constant, and high dielectric breakdown strength to achieve high volume efficiency and energy storage density for applications of capacitors and electric energy storage devices [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4] could be fabricated by combining the merits of polymers and ceramics. In order to achieve such an objective, high dielectric constant ferroelectric ceramics such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3(PMNPT), Pb(Zr,Ti)O3(PZT) and BaTiO3 (BT) have been used as fillers in polymers by previous workers [bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12]. Dielectric properties of 0–3 composites as a function of the volume fraction of the ceramic were studied by many authors [bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19]. Similarly, metallic fillers were also used to achieve ultra-high dielectric constant in the metal–polymer composites or three-phase composite systems [bib20 bib21 bib22]. Dielectric constants up to 200 were obtained in an irradiated PMNT-P(VDF-TrFE) 0–3 composite [bib7]. The most composite systems studied so far, were confined to ferroelectric ceramic fillers.', 'The CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramic which has centrosymmetric <i>bcc</i> structure (space group Im3, lattice parameter <i>a</i>\n                     ≈7.391Å and <i>Z</i>\n                     =2, has gained considerable attention due to its large dielectric constant (<i>ε</i>\n                     ∼104–5) which is nearly independent of frequency (up to 10MHz) and low thermal coefficient of permittivity (TCK) over 100–600K temperature range [bib23 bib24]. Several schools of thoughts exist to explain the origin of high dielectric constant observed in CCTO ceramics [bib23 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32]. Though several explanations have been put forward, the actual mechanism of the origin of giant dielectric constants in CCTO is still debatable as to whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic in nature. Recently, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) powders have been used as a filler and studied to explore the possibility of obtaining high dielectric constant composites for potential capacitor applications [bib33 bib34 bib35 bib36]. It was reported that, the dielectric constant as high as 740 at 1kHz was achieved for a composition of fixed concentration: 50vol.% CCTO and 50vol.% PVDF-TrFE [bib33]. The dielectric constant increases as the CCTO content increases in the polymer and decreases as the frequency increases [bib34 bib35 bib36]. A three-phase percolative composite with Aluminum powder yielded a high dielectric constant as high as 700 [bib34].', 'In this work we had used PVDF as matrix material because of its better thermal stability, tough and could be easily processed by injection mould/melt process. It has non-toxic, resistance to heat and chemicals and low water absorption characteristics which make it more suitable for making electronic components. The PVDF-CCTO composite fabricated for the first time by the melt mixing is reported in this work. In this article, the details pertaining to the fabrication and characterization of polymer–ceramic composites (PVDF/CCTO) involving CCTO as a filler and PVDF as matrix material are reported.']
