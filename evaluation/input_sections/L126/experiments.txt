[['Preparation of PVDF–CCTO composite', ['The CCTO powders were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction route by heating a stoichiometric mixture of CaCO3, TiO2 and CuO at 1000°C for 10h with intermediate repeated grinding [bib35]. The CCTO powders were ball milled for 10h in a planetary mill using agate container to obtain micrometer (1–7μm) sized particles. The Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), molecular weight of MW 530,000, supplied by Sigma–Aldrich was used in this work. For the fabrication of (PVDF/CCTO) composite, PVDF and CCTO powder were melt-mixed in a Brabender plasticorder (Model: PLE 331) for 15min at 175°C, and then hot-pressed at this temperature to obtain a sheet of 150mm2 with 0.5mm in thickness. A series of PVDF/CCTO composites with varying concentrations (0–55%) of CCTO by volume were fabricated.']], ['Characterization techniques', ['X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out using an XPERT-PRO Diffractometer (Philips, Netherlands) with Cu Kα1 radiation (<i>λ</i>\n                        =0.154056nm) in a wide range of 2<i>θ</i> (5°⩽2<i>θ</i>\n                        ⩽85°). Thermo gravimetric (TG) analyses were done using the TA Instruments (UK), Model: TGA Q500, with alumina as the reference material. The experiments were carried out at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 in flowing N2 atmosphere (flow rate: 50cm3\n                        min−1). The microstructure and the morphology of the samples were characterized by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Cambridge Stereoscan S-360). For dielectric measurements, samples were polished using emery papers containing successively finer abrasives to achieve perfectly parallel and smooth surfaces. The surfaces of the specimens were electroded with silver paste and cured at 50°C. The capacitance of the electroded specimen was measured as a function of frequency (100Hz–1MHz) using an impedance gain-phase analyzer (HP4194A) at room temperature. A two terminal capacitor configuration was employed for this measurement. Theoretical models like Maxwell’s, Clausius–Mossotti, Effective medium theory, logarithmic mixture rule and Yamada were employed to rationalize the dielectric behaviour of the composites under investigation.']]]
