['Using an experimental technique to measure the interfacial shear strength and critical aspect ratio in MWNT/polymer composites, it was found that:\n                        \n                           1.\n                           For matrices that can be dissolved after processing of the composites, and MWNT initially long enough that they can fail during loading, a fragmentation based test can be used to determine at least the relative ISS due to surface modification.\n                        \n                        \n                           2.\n                           For nanotubes that are well dispersed in the polycarbonate, the study found at a critical angle of 60°, there was a change in failure mechanism from pullout to fracture of the nanotubes due to bending shear stress.\n                        \n                        \n                           3.\n                           Using an analytical method, bounds for the interfacial stress were determined. The calculated interfacial shear strength for as-received nanotube falls between 4.83±2.87 and 13.72±8.23MPa, and that for treated nanotube falls in the range of 11.13±6.62 and 38.26±22.96MPa. These are reasonable values and show that ISS almost triples due to chemical treatment of the nanotube surface.\n                        \n                        \n                           4.\n                           In order to take advantage of the high modulus of MWNT, the aspect ratio of the MWNT needs to be well above 300, and a good guideline is 3000.']
