['Bisphenol A Polycarbonate (PC, Lexan 124, GE Plastics) was used as the polymer matrix. MWNTs were grown using a thermal chemical vapor deposition of xylene–ferrocene feedstock at 727°C in a quartz tube furnace [bib21 bib22]. Decomposition and deposition of the xylene– ferrocene vapor onto the substrate was allowed to proceed for the requisite time for a MWNT growth length of 1mm. The as-received multiwall nanotubes (ARNTs) were grown with a mean diameter of 31nm (standard deviation of 25.4nm). [fig2]\n                      shows a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) image of the untreated multiwall nanotubes. Using a method published earlier [bib23] the untreated nanotubes were chemically modified to create an epoxide terminated functionalized group (EPNT). The functionalized MWNTs react with the polycarbonate through a thermal trans-esterification reaction to create a covalent linkage between the MWNT and the matrix [bib24 bib25].', 'MWNT filled polycarbonate composites were prepared using a precipitation method. Bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC) was dried for 2h under vacuum at 125°C to remove any residual moisture and then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with sonication. The MWNTs were sonicated for 2min using a wand sonicator and the MWNT dispersion and PC solution were mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 3min. The mixture was poured drop-wise into methanol, precipitating the composite. The precipitated composite material was filtered under vacuum and dried under vacuum at 60°C for 15h. The samples were crushed using a mortar and pestle and dried under vacuum for an additional 12h. To remove any potential induced polymer crystallinity, the composite was then heated to 190°C for 1h. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to ensure that no crystallinity remained. Five weight percent (3.5vol.%) MWNT/polycarbonate composites (of both as-received and surface-modified states) were prepared. All samples for testing were made by compression molding 0.6g of material per sample in a Carver press at a temperature of 250°C and pressure of 1 ton for 5min.', 'The dog bone-shaped samples were failed in tension in liquid nitrogen to reduce plastic deformation, using ASTM D 638-02 with an Instron 3042 testing machine at a strain rate of 4%/min. The fractured edge of each sample was carefully embedded into an epoxy mixture and cured for 24h at 60°C in a vacuum oven ([fig3]\n                     ). The embedded specimens were ultramicrotomed perpendicular to the fractured edge, as illustrated in [fig3]a, to a thickness approximating 50nm using an RMC Product Ultra Microtome MTXL machine by Boeckler.', 'A TEM (Phillips CM12) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, JEOL 6335) were employed to characterize the morphology and dispersion of the MWNT within each sample. [fig3]b shows a schematic description of the key parameters investigated within this study: pullout length, pullout diameter and pullout angle. It should also be noted in [fig3]b that the measured pullout angle is the difference between the angle of the MWNT to the fracture edge and the loading direction. [fig3]c shows an FESEM image of the fracture surface with the MWNTs protruding from the surface and [fig3]d shows a typical TEM image taken as shown schematically in [fig3]a and b. ImageJ imaging software was used to measure the pull-out aspect ratio and angle of nanotubes along the fracture edge for the TEM images. In addition, the fragmentation aspect ratio of the MWNT in the grip section and 1mm from the fracture surface were determined by dissolving the matrix in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and placing a sample of each region on a TEM grid. Over 100 nanotubes were measured to obtain a statistically sound average aspect ratio. Since the grip region would not experience any deformation during loading, the distribution of aspect ratios in the grip region was used as a post-processing baseline.']
