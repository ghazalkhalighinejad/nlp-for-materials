['In order to optimize the properties of carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites, key micromechanical parameters, such as the nanotube/polymer interfacial shear stress (ISS) and load transfer length (or load transfer aspect ratio), must be quantified. Because these parameters are not well known in nanotube composites, it is difficult to compare measured mechanical properties to predicted values [bib1 bib2] particularly for short fiber composite models. In micron scale composites where the ISS and load transfer length can be directly measured, these quantities can be more reliably predicted [bib3 bib4]. For example, the lower than expected Young’s modulus observed in MWNT/polymer composites is often attributed to poor dispersion [bib5 bib6 bib7] or nanotube waviness [bib8]. In addition, however, MWNTs with an aspect ratio near or below the aspect ratio required for complete load transfer can also be the cause of low Young’s modulus. [fig1]\n                      shows a typical result from the Kelly–Tyson model in which load is transferred from the lower modulus matrix to the higher modulus fiber via a constant interfacial shear stress [bib9], perhaps due to plastic deformation at the interface or do to frictional load transfer. We use a simplified model such as Kelly–Tyson because the shape of the stress transfer function is unknown in these systems, and for the purposes of this paper, assuming a constant ISS is useful. If the strain is increased in the composite until the resulting fiber stress is larger than the failure stress, the fiber fractures ([fig1]a). If the aspect ratio (AR) of the fibers is too low (either as-grown or due to fracture during processing), then the equistrain condition is not met, and the fibers do not carry the maximum load ([fig1]c). Therefore, if the AR of the MWNT is too low, the Young’s modulus of the composite is reduced.', 'The load transfer aspect ratio changes as a function of applied strain ([fig1]a). In this paper, we determine the critical aspect ratio (ARc), which is defined as in [fig1]b and is a function both of the strength of the fiber and the fiber/matrix ISS. For purposes of discussion, if a constant ISS is assumed, then the ARc can be calculated as [bib10]\n                     \n                        \n                           (1)\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   L\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                   c\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                          \n                                             r\n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          σ\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          f\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          τ\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          ave\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     where <i>τ</i>ave\n                      is the average ISS, <i>σ</i>f\n                      is the strength of the fiber, (<i>L</i>c\n                     /<i>r</i>, critical fiber length/radius) is the ARc. If the ARc is measured, an average ISS can be calculated.', 'In order to measure ISS, and ARc, several micromechanical tests have been developed. In the fiber fragmentation test, a fiber of length, <i>L</i>, is placed in a composite and as the composite is loaded, the load in the fiber exceeds the fracture strength and fails. The aspect ratio at which the fiber is just long enough to reach an equistrain condition ([fig1]b), and thus reach the critical fiber failure stress, is the ARc. The ISS can then be calculated from the ARc with varying levels of complexity [bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. In addition, knowing the ARc is important for: (1) understanding fracture behavior because longer fibers can lead to improved damage resistance through crack bridging and (2) predicting the modulus of short fiber (or nanotube) composites [bib4 bib16 bib17].', 'A second test, the pullout test, uses the same principle as the fiber fragmentation test, but a fiber is embedded in a matrix, and the force to pullout the fiber is measured. The pullout force, <i>F</i>pullout\n                     , as a function of embedded length can be used to calculate the ISS as [bib9]\n                     \n                        \n                           (2)\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    τ\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    ave\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    pullout\n                                 \n                              \n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          F\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          pullout\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    2\n                                    π\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          rL\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          pullout', 'In addition, if the embedded aspect ratio is longer than the ARc, the fiber will break, and the pull-out aspect ratio will be the ARc.', 'Pioneering experiments by Wagner’s group [bib18 bib19 bib20] used nanoscale versions of these traditional micromechanical tests to measure the ISS in nanotube composites. Their results show direct evidence of increases in ISS due to surface modification of MWNT. Both pullout energies and interfacial shear strengths were measured from the pullout test.', 'The challenge in using the current nanoscale methods is that it is difficult to obtain the statistics necessary to fully characterize the interfacial behavior due to the complexity of the tests. The ARc is actually a distribution of values, and thus statistics are required. In this paper, using a bulk composite approach, the ARc and relative values of the ISS were measured as a function of interface modification. Additionally, using an analytical approach, the bounds for the ISS were calculated.']
