Study on microstructure and dielectric property of the BaTiO3/epoxy resin composites
High dielectric permittivity barium titanate/epoxy resin (BaTiO3/EPR) composites with different size BaTiO3 particles were prepared and their dielectric properties were studied via a wide range of temperature and frequency. The results show that an appropriate silane coupling agent can be used in order to improve the interaction between BaTiO3 and EPR, and subsequently induces a high dielectric permittivity and a low loss tangent. The size and concentration of BaTiO3 particles also have an effect on the microstructure and dielectric property of composites. Additionally, the dielectric properties of the composites with different size of BaTiO3 particles give different temperature dependence because of the existence of phase transition of large size BaTiO3 particles at its Curie temperature.
