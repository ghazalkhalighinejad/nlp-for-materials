[['Curing characteristics of the BaTiO3/EPR composites', ['To understand of the curing behavior, the FTIR results of non-cured pure EPR, cured pure EPR and the BaTiO3/EPR composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3 at 30vol% were shown in [fig1]\n                        a. It is well known that the plane stretching vibration of epoxide group at 913.25cm−1 is the characteristic peak of EPR. Obviously, non-cured EPR in [fig1]a-1 displayed the characteristic peak of EPR at 913.25cm−1. However, after the materials were cured, the characteristic peaks at 913.25cm−1 disappeared as shown in results of [fig1]a-2 and a-3. Therefore, it could be suggested that the BaTiO3/EPR composites had been cured relative completely by mean of our curing process and other materials, such as harder MeTHPA and catalyst 2,4-EMI.', 'DSC analyses of the cured pure EPR and the composites with different concentration of BaTiO3 are shown in [fig1]b. Data obtained from the DSC curves are shown in [tbl2]\n                        . The temperature of glass transition peak (<i>T</i>\n                        g) of pure cured EPR is 69.4°C, glass transition temperature of the composites changes with increase of the volume fraction of BT-07. It can be found that the <i>T</i>\n                        g decreases firstly when the concentration of BaTiO3 particles is less than 0.3. The existence of BT-07 in EPR polymer reduces the degree of cross linking and also the glass transition temperature decreases. However, the result is just opposite when the volume fraction of BT-07 is more than 0.4. The composite with BT-07 at 0.7 contains only a little epoxy and maybe forms a continuous random cluster, which might induce to form small aggregated cluster structure. As a result, because of the appearance of voids, the glass transition temperature of the composites with BT-07 decreases. And the heats of glass transitions (Δ<i>H</i>\n                        g) also decrease with an increase in the content of BaTiO3. The DSC thermograph of [fig1]b shows that the endothermic heat decreases with increasing temperature, and appears an abrupt decrease at glass transition temperature. Additionally, all of the composites with BT-07 at different fraction appear another peak at nearly Curie temperature (about 130°C), which is relevant to the crystal phase transition temperature of BaTiO3. The results suggest that the introduction of BaTiO3 particles in the composites would change the mobility of the EPR molecules, and therefore, a decrease of <i>T</i>\n                        g in the composites could be noticed.']], ['Microstructure and dielectric property of the BaTiO3/EPR composites with and without coupling agent', ['Microstructures of fractured cross-section of the composites (loading 0.1μm and 0.7μm BaTiO3 at 60vol%) with and without KH550 were shown in [fig2]\n                        a–d. It could be found that the KH550 improved the interaction between EPR and BaTiO3 particles, and therefore the ceramic particles are homogeneous into EPR. Same results can also reported in our past work and other references [bib5]. Main factors with being charge of the high dielectric permittivity in the composite with KH550 modifying BaTiO3/epoxy composites is similar to BaTiO3/PVDF composite [bib5]. Additionally, the dispersant of phosphated ester (BYK-9010) possess some organic acid groups in its molecular structure. The acid groups may induce an interaction with ceramic filler via an acid-base neutralization process, which, in turn, facilitated the dispersion of the ceramic filler within the EPR matrix [bib10 bib11]. EPR alone would not take advantage of this interaction process; meanwhile, the anhydride hardener was deficient in stoichiometry against epoxide groups. As a result, as shown in [fig3]\n                        a and b, an increase in dielectric permittivity and a decrease in loss tangent were observed in the BaTiO3/EPR composite with the silane coupling agent. It is clearly that the size of BaTiO3 has an effect on the dielectric property of the composites after optimizing the processing conditions. As a result, the dielectric property of the composite with BT-07 is obviously better than that with BT-01. Comparing with [fig2]c and d, the compatibility between BaTiO3 and EPR is improved obviously. The results suggested that the coupling agent as well as the dispersant could improve the composite miscibility and subsequently created the expectable dielectric properties.']], ['Microstructure and dielectric property of the BaTiO3/EPR composites at room temperature', ['[fig4]\n                         showed morphologies of fractured cross-section of the composites loading 0.7μm and 0.1μm BaTiO3 at 60vol% and 75vol%, respectively. It can be seen from [fig4]a and b that the EPR is self-connected into a continuous phase while ceramic particles are randomly dispersed in the matrix, and the BaTiO3 particles are surrounded by the EPR. Few voids can be observed on the fractured surfaces of the composites at 60vol% loading. However, it is very clear that the pores appear slowly with an increase of BaTiO3 concentration (at 75vol%), which can be seen in [fig4]a′ and b′, and the pores are very remarkable. The observed morphologies would be used to explain the results of dielectric properties as shown in [fig5]\n                        . Namely, we can observe from [fig5]a that the dielectric properties of the composites with 0.7μm and 0.1μm BaTiO3 at 60vol% are almost not dependent on frequency. However, the dielectric permittivity of the composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3 is significantly larger than that with 0.1μm one at 60vol% while keeping almost the same loss tangent. The large dielectric permittivity in the composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3 can be attributed to the increase of dielectric permittivity of the ceramic powders resulted from the increase of tetragonality phase and occurrence of clusters structure of BaTiO3 \n                        [bib12]. As the ceramic loading volume increase, the dielectric predominance of the composites with 0.7μm BaTiO3 is more obvious. However, because of the effect of pores at 70vol% as shown in [fig4]a′ and b′, the dielectric properties of the composites at 70vol% always decrease with an increase in frequency. The dielectric permittivity of the composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3 is only slightly larger than that with 0.1μm one while displaying a remarkable loss tangent in the composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3. The results suggested that both the size of BaTiO3 particles and microstructure of the composites played an important role on deciding the final dielectric property of the BaTiO3/EPR composites.']], ['Dependence of dielectric property of the BaTiO3/EPR composites on the concentration of BaTiO3 at different frequencies', ['[fig6]\n                        a and b shows the dependence of dielectric properties of the BaTiO3/EPR composites with 0.1μm and 0.7μm BaTiO3 on the volume concentration of BaTiO3 at different frequencies (103\n                        Hz and 106\n                        Hz), respectively. Whatever frequency it was, in comparison with the dielectric permittivity of the composites with 0.7μm BaTiO3, we could observe that as the amount of BaTiO3 powders increased, the dielectric permittivity of the composites with 0.1μm BaTiO3 was low when the concentration of BaTiO3 was less than 70vol%. However, when the concentration of BaTiO3 arrived the value of 75vol%, a valuable result appeared. Namely in this case, the dielectric permittivity of the composite with 0.1μm BaTiO3 was larger than that with 0.7μm. Additionally, herein we also had to emphasize that the loss tangent for two kinds of composites kept the same rule. It was assumed that there was more chance for BaTiO3 particles to form a continuous random cluster with a decrease in particle size [bib13]. Therefore, compared with 0.7μm BaTiO3 particle, the particles with 0.1μm in diameter displayed a less chance to form voids and pores in its composites. As a result, the dipole–dipole interaction increased and contributed to higher dielectric permittivity. While at about 70vol%, the dielectric permittivity of the composites with 0.7μm BaTiO3 reached a maximum value and then decreased with further increasing the concentration of BaTiO3. The decrease in dielectric permittivity was mainly due to the formation of voids and pores, which could be clearly found as shown in [fig4]a′.']], ['Temperature dependence of dielectric property of the BaTiO3/EPR composites', ['[fig7]\n                        a and b shows respectively temperature dependences of dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of the BaTiO3/EPR composites with 0.1μm and 0.7μm BaTiO3 at 70vol% and 103\n                        Hz. Both of the dielectric permittivity and loss tangent always increase with the temperature; they increase when the temperature is over 45°C as shown in [fig7]a and b. Additionally, the dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of the composite with 0.7μm BaTiO3 at 70vol% are always larger than those with 0.1μm one. Generally speaking, the change of dielectric property in the composites includes three competitive mechanisms: (a) segmental mobility of polymer is increased with the temperature, which should increase the permittivity, (b) thermal expansion of resin could disrupt the chains of contact BaTiO3 particles, which should decrease the permittivity, and (c) the structure of BaTiO3 particles could be changed with an increase in temperature (before Curie temperature), which could generate a modification on the dielectric response of the filler [bib14].', 'It is well known that the Curie temperature of pure BaTiO3 is about 120°C. However, because of the existence of epoxy as matrix and the different size and quality of BaTiO3 particle, the Curie temperature may shift up or down. As shown in DSC results (see [fig1]b), a small peak can be seen at around 130°C because of the existence of phase transition of 0.7μm BaTiO3 in the composite. The phase transition becomes a main factor to produce the effect on dielectric properties instead of the EPR matrix. The effect is more effective in high temperature and at low frequency [bib15]. However, the phase transition in the composite with 0.1μm BaTiO3 is not very remarkable because the change rule of dielectric permittivity in the composite with 0.1μm BaTiO3 is not different with that in the composite with 0.7μm one. Below 40°C, the difference of dielectric permittivity in two kinds of composites is very negligible, which can be seen in the inset of [fig7]a. The results suggested that the temperature would play a key role on determining the dielectric permittivity of the BaTiO3/EPR composites when it was beyond 40°C. The loss tangent values increase abruptly ([fig7]b) in the region of 60–80°C. As the temperature increases, the loss tangent abrupt increases mainly around <i>T</i>\n                        g. At the temperature near <i>T</i>\n                        g the dipoles might begin to have enough mobility to contribute to the loss tangent and dielectric permittivity.']]]
