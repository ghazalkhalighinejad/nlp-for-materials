[['Raw materials', ['Barium titanate (BaTiO3) was chosen as ceramic filler because it was widely used as ferroelectric material with high dielectric permittivity. In this study, two kinds of BaTiO3 powers (0.1μm and 0.7μm, which are denoted as BT-01 and BT-07 respectively) were from Guoteng electronic ceramic company. Their particle sizes and other physical parameters that were acquired at room temperature were summarized in [tbl1]\n                        . The epoxy resin (EPR), bisphenol-A epoxy resin (DER661 from Dow chemical) with a dielectric permittivity of 3.7, was chosen as polymer matrix. It is in a solid state at room temperature and can be dissolved in acetone. To achieve a good dispersion of the ceramic in the EPR matrix composites, silane coupling agent (KH550) and phosphated ester (BYK-9010) dispersant were used as surface treatment agents in order to improve the dielectric permittivity of the composites and the miscibility between polymer and ceramic particles. The amount of KH550 and BYK-9010 was 1.0wt% in comparison with the BaTiO3 powders used. Methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MeTHPA, from Aldrich) that was often used during the preparation of EPR-type electronic materials was chosen as a harder in 10/4 (EPR/MeTHPA) weight ratio. The catalyst was 2-ethyl-4-methyl-imidazole (2,4-EMI), its concentration is about 1.0wt% in comparison to the content of EPR for all composites.']], ['Preparation of the BaTiO3/EPR composites', ['First, suspensions containing BaTiO3 powder, KH550 and solvent were prepared in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bottle. Ultrasonic was applied to the suspensions in order to prohibit from the agglomeration of BaTiO3 powders, and then EPR, curing agent and catalyst were added into the suspensions. The mixture solutions were grinded by using a planetary ball-milling machine for 24h. Afterwards, the solution was heated to 75°C for 1h to evaporate the most solvent, then dried at 75°C for 30min to remove solvent residue. Finally, the dry mixtures were molded by hot-pressing at a temperature range of 150–160°C in order to satisfy the curing process of the BaTiO3/EPR composites.']], ['Characterization of the BaTiO3/EPR composites', ['Curing characteristics of composites were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR: Nexus 670) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC: Dupont TA 2010) measurements. The fractured surface morphologies of the BaTiO3/EPR composites were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4700).']], ['Dielectric measurement of the BaTiO3/EPR composites', ['The alternating current (ac) dielectric properties of the composite samples were measured using an impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A) both in the frequency ranges of 102–106\n                        Hz and in temperature ranges from −60°C to 150°C. Prior to measurement, electrodes were deposited with gold on the two sides of all samples.']]]
