['The BaTiO3/EPR composites with a good miscibility can be prepared by employing the optimum amount of silane coupling agent, and therefore, the dielectric permittivity of the composites can be improved significantly while keeping a low loss tangent. The size and concentration of BaTiO3 particles also result in obvious effect on morphology and dielectric properties of composites. The use of larger size BaTiO3 particles can increase the dielectric permittivity of the composites due to the existence of the tetragonality BaTiO3. However, when the amount of the BaTiO3 particles reach 75vol%, the dielectric permittivity of the composites with 0.1μm BaTiO3 continue to increase, not the case for the composites with 0.7μm BaTiO3 because of the existence of voids and pores. Additionally, temperature dependence of dielectric properties of two kinds of composites is different because there is a remarkable phase transition for large size BaTiO3 particle when the temperature is near its Curie temperature.']
