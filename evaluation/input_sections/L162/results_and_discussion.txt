[['Microstructural characterization', ['The good level of dispersion of nanofillers within the P(S-BuA) matrix can be seen on [fig3]\n                         which shows an example of TEM observations on composites. Indeed, no aggregate can be observed and both nanotubes and nanofibrils seem to be isolated and homogeneously distributed. It is remarkable that on a composite microsection, nano-fibers seem to be shorter and less entangled than what they are really in the corresponding macroscopic sample, because of the small observed thickness.']], ['Glass transition temperature', ['DSC analysis highlighted the influence of processing conditions and filler content on the P(S-BuA) glass transition temperature, <i>T</i>\n                        g. Indeed, FP materials systematically present <i>T</i>\n                        g about 4K lower than those of E materials. As an example, the pure P(S-BuA) matrix has a <i>T</i>\n                        g of 266K when evaporated and of 262K when freeze-dried. This observation suggested a strong influence of the processing on the surfactant organization within the polymer. Indeed, the surfactant used here is known to have a plasticizing effect on latex films. After the latex film formation by slow evaporation, the surfactant molecules can be either solubilized in the polymer, dispersed as aggregates within the film, or segregated at the film surface or at the film-substrate interface [bib24]. The freeze-drying step followed by hot-pressing could strongly limit the eventual segregation and migration of surfactant molecules. Thus, the residual amount of surfactant in the film would be higher. A higher amount of surfactant solubilized in the polymer would lead to a lower <i>T</i>\n                        g because of the plasticizing effect. Moreover, the presence of nanofillers in the latex may modify the equilibrium established between surfactant molecules solubilized in the matrix and those segregated or adsorbed on filler surface. Indeed, for each process and for both kind of fillers, <i>T</i>\n                        g increases with the filler volume fraction. Nowadays, this problem of surfactant arrangement in latex films is still the object of numerous scientific publications [bib25] and is far from being completely understood. In the continuation of the present paper, in order to be free of this problem in the analysis of the results, the latter will be presented as a function of the ratio <i>T</i>/<i>T</i>\n                        α, with <i>T</i>\n                        α the main relaxation temperature.']], ['Viscoelastic behavior', [['DMA results', ['The storage modulus <i>G</i>′ (which is indicative of the elastic behavior of the polymer) determined by DMA measurements for the pure P(S-BuA) matrix and related composite materials filled with 1.5 and 3vol% of carbon nanotubes are plotted versus the normalized temperature in [fig4]\n                           . The unfilled P(S-BuA) matrix displays classical behavior of amorphous thermoplastic polymer; well below <i>T</i>\n                           α (281K for the E matrix), the polymer is in the glassy state with a modulus roughly constant (around 1GPa). When <i>T</i>\n                           α is reached, a strong decrease of the elastic shear modulus (by more than 3 decades) occurs, corresponding to a peak of the loss factor tan(<i>δ</i>). Above <i>T</i>\n                           α the material is in the rubbery state until it starts to flow (here at around 350K) and to behave as a viscous fluid and, then the experimental apparatus fails.', 'When this matrix is filled with MWNTs, and whatever the processing condition used, a mechanical reinforcement effect is observed, increasing with the nanotube content. Below <i>T</i>\n                           α, the increase in the modulus with nanotube content is moderate but the nanotubes efficiency above <i>T</i>\n                           α is higher. Moreover, both 1.5 and 3vol% MWNTs filled E systems display a large rubbery plateau where the modulus is almost constant with the temperature. This strong increase in composite thermo-mechanical stability cannot be only understood by interactions between the polymer chains and the nanotube surface, but the formation of a percolating entangled nanotube network within the material has to be taken into account. Entanglements between tubes explain the elastic modulus measured in this large temperature range (where the pure matrix behaves as a viscous fluid). The [fig5]\n                            shows the difference between a simple contact and an entangled contact between two fibers. Entanglements within a fibrous structure are indeed responsible for the elastic response of this structure (like in glass wool for example).', 'FP composites with the same nanotube contents do not display such a strong increase in flow temperature. Indeed, nearly the same mechanical reinforcement is measured but the FP materials rapidly flow. A scheme is proposed in [fig6]\n                            to explain this effect of processing conditions on thermo-mechanical results. During the slow evaporation, because of Brownian motions in the suspension (whose viscosity remains low, up to the end of the process when the particle concentration becomes very high), the rearrangement of the nanofibers is possible. The resulting structure (after the coalescence of polymer particles) is completely relaxed and entanglements between the long and flexible nanofibers are then created. Conversely, during the FP process, the particle arrangement in the suspension is first frozen, and then, during the hot-pressing, because of the melted polymer viscosity, the nanofiber rearrangements are strongly limited. In the resulting structure, the nanofibers are more isolated from each other (cf: [fig6]), fiber/fiber contacts are mainly simple contacts, and very few entanglements are created. This latter FP microstructure will lead to a weak thermo-mechanical stability. Indeed, when the polymer is viscous, as only few entanglements exist between nanotubes, the composite flow (at a lightly higher temperature because of interactions between polymer chains and nanotubes).', 'However, entanglements between nanotubes appear to have a low effect on the mechanical reinforcement. Thus, the increase in modulus is mainly due to stress transfer between matrix and nanotubes.', '[fig7]\n                            presents DMA results obtained on cellulose nanofibrils filled composites. Here again, an increase of the flow temperature is observed in both E and FP materials. This delay of the material flowing is due to the interactions between the polymer chains and the nanofibrils surface. For E materials, the slope value (in absolute value) of the rubber plateau is slightly lower for the composites than for the unfilled matrix. This can be explained by an increasing contrast between the fibrils and the matrix modulus when the matrix modulus decreases. Indeed, this contrast is known to have a great influence on the reinforcement effect of the fillers. For E composites, the modulus in the rubbery state appears constant with the temperature for nanofibril content higher or equal to 3vol%. As supposed previously for MWNTs filled composites, such a long plateau results from a percolating filler network formed within the matrix. Nevertheless, the level of this modulus plateau is strongly higher for E cellulose filled composites than for E MWNTs filled ones with the same filler contents. This means that the rigidity of the nanofibril network is higher than that of the nanotube network. The rigidity of this cellulosic network is actually due to the strong hydrogen bonds which can be created between nanofibrils because of the high number of hydroxyl groups on their surface [bib2]. Up to the degradation of the cellulose (which occurs for a temperature around 500K), the composite modulus is governed by this network rigidity. Thus, in this case, the mechanical reinforcement observed here is more the result of strong links between nanofibers than an entanglement effect.', 'Conversely, compared to E materials, cellulose filled FP materials present a mechanical reinforcement less important and the difference between the slopes on the rubbery plateau is smaller for such materials. This excludes the presence of this rigid nanofibril network in such materials. Thus, the FP process not only prevents entanglements creation between nanofibers (scheme proposed in [fig6]) but also, the fiber/fiber contacts created during this process cannot be considered as direct contacts but are made through a certain amount of polymer matrix (or maybe surfactant in the case of nanotube fillers). This observation is confirmed by the previous results of Favier et al. [bib2] which established the fact that the freeze-drying process prevents or, at least, limits the creation of hydrogen bonds between cellulose nanofillers. Consequently, the modulus of the FP composites is only due to stress transfer between the matrix and the nanofibrils and decreases with the temperature.']], ['Mechanical modeling', ['Various models exist for the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials.

[fd1]).', 'In order to fit Eq. [fd2] to the experimental data for cellulose filled composites in the rubbery state, we used for the fibers a longitudinal modulus <i>E</i>\n                           f11 equal to 30GPa and transversal moduli <i>E</i>\n                           f22 and <i>E</i>\n                           f33 equal to 15GPa. These values were taken from the literature on cellulose fibrils [bib29]. In the rubbery state, the fiber aspect ratio is the main parameter influencing the reinforcement level. To well fit the modulus of the cellulose filled composites above <i>T</i>\n                           α, an aspect ratio (ratio of the length to the diameter of the fiber) of 312 is used. Even if high resolution electron microscopy on cellulosic objects is impossible, this aspect ratio value seems to be reasonable and is comparable to the estimation made by E. Dinand [bib30]. [fig8]\n                            shows the result of this model compared to the experimental data when the composites are in the rubbery state (<i>T</i>/<i>T</i>\n                           α\n                           =1.15) for different fiber contents. It can be observed that the mechanical reinforcement for cellulose filled FP materials can be well modeled by the isotropic Halpin–Kardos calculation. Indeed such a model takes into account the modulus of each phase, as well as the geometry of the particles, but the particles are assumed to have no interaction among each other. This is consistent with the assumption of no strong hydrogen bonds between nanofibrils in FP materials. And, as expected, the mechanical reinforcement for E cellulose filled materials cannot be described by this mean field approach because of the presence of these strong filler–filler interactions.', 'In order to understand this underestimation, it is worth considering the effect of this nanofibrils rigid network. An approach, called the mechanical percolation model, consists in the series-parallel model of Tagayanagi extended by Ouali et al. [bib31] and then by Kolařík [bib32] and Favier et al. [bib2] with a percolation concept. In this model, the composite is described by a parallel mechanical coupling of a rigid phase, made of a theoretical volume fraction of fiber network, and a soft one, made of the matrix reinforced with the fibers out of the network (i.e. dead branches and isolated aggregates). The network volume fraction is calculated from the percolation theory [bib33]. In the case of randomly distributed objects, the volume fraction <i>P</i> of percolated structure depends on the total volume fraction of objects, <i>ψ</i>, and is given by:\n

percolation threshold and <i>b</i>, the critical exponent. As assumed by De Gennes [bib34], the dead branches do not participate actively in stress transmission. An account of only the backbone of the structure requires a value of b close to 1.8. The percolation threshold can be approximated to 0.23vol% by using the law established by Nan [bib35] for straight rods, with an aspect ratio of 312 randomly dispersed in 3D. The shear modulus, <i>G</i>, of the composite is then given by:\n                              \n                                 (5)\n                                 \n                                    G\n                                    =\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          (\n                                          1\n                                          -\n                                          2\n                                          P\n                                          (\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          +\n                                          P\n                                          (\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          \n                                             \n                                                G\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                s\n                                             \n                                          \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                G\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                r\n                                             \n                                          \n                                          +\n                                          (\n                                          1\n                                          -\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          P\n                                          (\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          \n                                             \n                                                G\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                r\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                2\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                       \n                                          (\n                                          1\n                                          -\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          \n                                             \n                                                G\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                r\n                                             \n                                          \n                                          +\n                                          (\n                                          ψ\n                                          -\n                                          P\n                                          (\n                                          ψ\n                                          )\n                                          )\n                                          \n                                             \n                                                G\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                s\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           where <i>G</i>\n                           r and <i>G</i>\n                           s are, respectively, the shear moduli of the reinforcing phase (fiber percolating network) and of the soft one (the matrix). The modulus of the cellulose network, which obviously differs from that of isolated nanofibrils, can be estimated by measuring the elastic properties of a film made only of cellulose nanofibrils. The Young’s modulus <i>E</i>\n                           r was experimentally measured in tension and found to be 5GPa. This value is close to the one reported by Dufresne et al.

Assuming that the mechanical properties of nanofibrils sheets are isotropic, the shear modulus <i>G</i>\n                           r can be calculated from <i>E</i>\n                           r by taking a Poisson’s ratio generally used for stiff systems (<i>ν</i>\n                           =0.3):\n                              \n                                 (6)\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          G\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          r\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    =\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                E\n                                             \n                                             \n                                                r\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                       \n                                          2\n                                          (\n                                          1\n                                          +\n                                          ν\n                                          )\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           The shear modulus values <i>G</i>′ obtained from this percolation approach are found in Fig. 8 to be in good agreement with the mechanical measurements for E cellulose filled composites. For nanofibril volume fraction <i>ψ</i> lower than the percolation threshold <i>ψ</i>\n                           c, nanofibrils get connected in small isolated aggregates, so that <i>P</i>(<i>ψ</i>)=0 and the model is reduced to a series model which implies a low mechanical reinforcement.

These values appear very close to those of FP cellulose filled composites. Consequently, the mean field calculation seems adapted for MWNTs filled composites. As already mentioned before, no strong interactions are possible between carbon nanotubes, and thus a mechanical percolation phenomenon cannot occur. For instance, to model the modulus of the 3vol% MWNTs filled E material in the glassy state, a filler longitudinal modulus of 300GPa is required in the Halpin–Kardos isotropic calculation (Eq. [fd2]), almost independently on the aspect ratio. However, with the same fiber longitudinal modulus and an aspect ratio of 300, the mechanical reinforcement in the rubbery state is fitted. This value for the MWNTs longitudinal Young’s modulus is lower than what is found in the literature (Demczyk and co-workers found for example by bending tests a longitudinal modulus of 910GPa for MWNTs [bib10]). As it can be observed on [fig3], the carbon nanotubes remain curved and entangled within the composite. Fisher et al. [bib37] have shown by finite element calculation that the effective modulus of the tubes in composite materials is lower than their real longitudinal modulus and depends on their aspect ratio and their waviness ratio.', 'Nevertheless, the mean field approach alone cannot explain the fact that the nanotubes delay the flow of the material. Such a model does not take into account the mechanical interactions between fibers. Thus, the effect of entanglements between tubes is not taken into account.', 'In the case of conductive fillers, such as MWNTs, the investigation of the composite electrical percolation is of interest and could give information on the tube/tube contact properties in E and FP materials.']]]], ['Electrical properties', ['[fig9]\n                         shows the evolution of the real part of the electrical conductivity with the frequency for carbon nanotubes filled materials. The P(S-BuA) matrix displays a classical dielectric material behavior, with an electrical conductivity increasing with the frequency for high values of frequency (>1Hz). For the evaporated composite filled with 0.2vol% the same type of behavior can be observed with a conductivity level higher than for the matrix and a dependency of the conductivity with the frequency which appears later (for <i>f</i>\n                        >104\n                        Hz). This composite displays a capacitive behavior which corresponds to a conductive filler/polymer composite really close to the percolation threshold. For higher nanotube contents (0.5 and 3vol%), the composites electrical behavior is completely different, the conductivity is much higher (28Sm−1 for 3vol% of MWNTs) and remains constant with the frequency: the materials exhibit purely real resistivity. In this case, the material is above the percolation threshold; there is a connective network of nanotubes within the matrix. The same type of results was obtained in the same range of conductivity value by Sandler et al. [bib20] for epoxy/nanotubes composites or Benoit et al. [bib18] on PMMA/nanotubes composites. For FP materials, electrical conductivity level is systematically lower than for E materials and this transition from a capacitive behavior towards a resistive behavior appears for higher nanotube volume fraction. Indeed, the FP composite filled with 0.5vol% of MWNTs displays a dielectric behavior really close to that of the pure matrix whereas the E one already displays high conductivity level with a resistive behavior.', 'The real part of the AC conductivity values at 1Hz as a function of the nanotube content are plotted in [fig10]\n                        .

By using a linear fit on the log–log curve plotting the conductivity as a function of the reduced volume fraction (<i>ψ</i>\n                        −\n                        <i>ψ</i>\n                        c)/(1−\n                        <i>ψ</i>\n                        c), as shown in the inset of [fig10], the exponent <i>t</i> was found to be 1.7 and 3.9 for E and FP materials, respectively. Percolation thresholds <i>ψ</i>\n                        c were adjusted to the values which give the best linear regression for <i>ψ</i> close to <i>ψ</i>\n                        c. Thresholds of 0.18vol% and 0.45vol% were found for E and FP composites, respectively.', 'E materials present a classical percolation behavior of a system composed of high aspect ratio conductive fillers well-dispersed in an insulating matrix. Different numerical approaches found the same range for the critical exponent in conductivity of binary systems, between 1.7 and 2 in 3D [bib38 bib39 bib40]. Thus, the value of <i>t</i> obtained on E materials is consistent with this “universal” value. Low percolation thresholds were also found in other carbon nanotubes/polymer composites by Sandler et al. [bib20], Benoit et al. [bib18] or Regev et al. [bib21]. It confirms the good dispersion of very high aspect ratio conductive nanotubes in the polymer matrix. Indeed, as discussed by Nan [bib35], the percolation threshold is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the dispersed objects.', 'However, several numerical and experimental studies discussed the universality of the percolation critical exponent for conductivity properties [bib41 bib42 bib43]. Such theoretical studies demonstrated that in binary systems a distribution of the contact conductivity depending on the volume fraction of fillers (Balberg used tunneling conductance for example [bib41]) systematically leads to a critical exponent higher than the “universal” one. The lower conductivity level and the elevated value of <i>t</i> obtained for FP materials suggest that the freeze-drying process leads to a weaker electrical contact efficiency between carbon nanotubes. Indeed, as it was assumed previously with cellulose nanofibrils, the FP process leads to indirect contacts between nanotubes through matrix or surfactant, i.e. less conductive contacts. As supposed previously to explain DSC results, the FP process can certainly lead to a higher surfactant content in the composites. A part of this surfactant can be adsorbed on nanotube surface and is responsible for a weaker tube/tube contact electrical conductivity. [fig9] shows the low conductivity level of this surfactant (SDBS) and highlights its effect on the contact conductivity between nanotubes. Indeed, two films made of carbon nanotubes without polymer matrix were processed: one made by evaporation of raw MWNTs dispersed in ethanol, and the other from aqueous dispersion of MWNTs with SDBS. Both films are highly conductive but the use of surfactant (which has a an intermediate conductivity between that of the matrix and that of pure MWNTs as shown in [fig9]) induces a weaker conductivity level (1300Sm−1 for pure MWNTS and 330Sm−1 MWNTs with SDBS). This is the result of the presence of surfactant at the contacts between nanotubes.', 'Moreover, in the FP systems, the contact conductivity may evolve with the nanotube volume fraction. Indeed, as discussed previously, the structure after the FP process is not relaxed, and the higher the nanotube content, the more constrained contacts between tubes. The contact electrical efficiency may thus increase with the nanotube content. Percolation theory were fitted for FP materials by using a percolation threshold more than two times higher than for E materials. Usually, the increase in percolation threshold is related to changes in the microstructure. This is consistent with the assumption made in [fig6]. Indeed, the FP process leads to a nanotube structure which is not completely relaxed, thus they could remain more tortuous than in the E composites. Such nanotubes with higher tortuosity can be compared to equivalent fillers with a lower aspect ratio, inducing a higher percolation threshold. A discrete modeling approach taking into account the morphology of such nanotube filled nanocomposites and the electrical properties of the tubes themselves and of the tube–tube contacts were developed to discuss this influence of the processing conditions on the electrical percolation.
