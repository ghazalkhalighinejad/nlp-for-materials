[['Characterization', ['A drop of diluted suspension of MWNTs in ethanol or cellulose nanofibrils in water was deposited on amorphous carbon-coated TEM grids and then observed at room temperature using a JEOL 200CX transmission electron microscope (TEM).', 'In order to check the nanocomposites homogeneity (i.e. the dispersion of the nanofillers in the matrix), conventional TEM observations were also performed on composite materials. The samples were cut by cryo-ultramicrotomy using a Ultracut Reichert S. The temperature of the sample was set to −20°C and the speed of the glass knife was 4mms−1. The thin sections of about 60nm thick were dry-collected and were placed on a 400-mesh copper grid.', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a Perkin–Elmer Pyris Diamond apparatus with a heating rate of 10K/min. The glass transition temperature, <i>T</i>\n                        g, mentioned in the text refers to the temperature of the inflexion point on DSC data.', 'For the mechanical characterization, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements were performed in torsion mode at a fixed frequency (0.1Hz) from 200K to 450K with a heating rate of 1K/min. The storage (<i>G</i>′) and the loss (<i>G</i>″) moduli of the complex shear modulus (<i>G</i>\n                        ∗) and the loss factor tan(<i>δ</i>) (<i>G</i>″/<i>G</i>′) were measured as a function of temperature. Sample dimensions were about 10×3×0.6mm3. The main relaxation temperature <i>T</i>\n                        α is defined here as the temperature where the maximum of tan(<i>δ</i>) is reached.', 'Electrical conductivity measurements were carried out. Parallelepipedic samples (around 5×15×0.7mm3) were coated at their ends with a silver paint to ensure a good electrical contact with the electrodes.

The chemical treatment used is described by Dinand et al. [bib6]. This treatment allows to obtain a final aqueous suspension of cellulose nanofibrils which does not sediment or flocculate. A TEM observation of this cellulosic fibrils is presented in [fig1]\n                           . Because of cellulose degradation under the electron beam, TEM high magnification observations and thus the observation of individual nanofibrils are really difficult to run. Nevertheless, one can observe in [fig1] that cellulose nanofibrils are arranged in bundles of 10–50nm width. The cellulose relative density is 1.58gcm−3.']], ['Multi-walled carbon nanotubes', ['These were synthesized at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) from the catalytic decomposition of acetylene at 720°C on supported cobalt/iron catalyst as already described [bib22]. For purification, raw MWNTs sample was sonicated in 30% HNO3 for 3h then filtered and washed with distilled water and finally dried at 120°C. As shown in [fig2]\n                           , the purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes used in this study are pure, very long (mean length around 8μm), flexible and entangled. Couteau and co-workers [bib22] previously showed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis that with this purification process the Fe (<i>K</i>\n                           α 6.4eV and <i>K</i>\n                           β 7.06eV) and Co (<i>K</i>\n                           α 6.93eV and <i>K</i>\n                           β 7.65eV) peaks are drastically reduced in the purified sample. This means that the metallic catalysts are mainly removed by the purification step. Image analysis made on several TEM pictures gives a diameter distribution between 8nm and 105nm with a mean value around 32nm. The relative density of MWNTs can be estimated to 2gcm−3 by taking into account the volume of graphite (relative density 2.2gcm−3) in a nanotube.', 'The purified nanotubes were then dispersed in a distilled water solution of 1.2gL−1 sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS: C18H29SO3Na) surfactant using a sonication step for 10min with 20mL suspension volumes, using a Branson Sonifier with a 13mm probe tip at 20KHz and a power source of 25W. Several weight ratios of nanotubes to surfactant were investigated for solution stability and an optimum ratio of five (5:1) was chosen to obtain an aqueous suspension stable for at least 3 weeks. This weight ratio corresponds to six surfactant molecules per nm2 of available nanotube surface (calculation made with an average tube diameter of 32nm), or in other words a surface available for each molecule of 14Å2, which seems reasonable. The quality and the homogeneity of this MWNTs aqueous suspension was established by new environmental scanning electron microscopy observations. Bogner et al. [bib23] have developed a new device which allowed the observation of aqueous dispersion in transmission. Latex and carbon nanotubes dispersion previously mentioned were observed and found to present a good state of dispersion without aggregates.']], ['The latex matrix', ['This was prepared by emulsion copolymerization of styrene (35wt%) and butyl acrylate (65wt%) at the LCPP (Laboratoire de Chimie et Procédés de Polymérisation, UMR CNRS 140-CPE Lyon, BP 2077, 69616 Villeurbanne Cedex, France). The polymerization occurs in a miscellar aqueous solution of a surfactant mixture: an anionic (C12H25O(CH2CH2O)4SO3Na) and a non-ionic (C12H25O(CH2CH2O)19H). A surfactant-stabilized aqueous suspension of poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate), P(S-BuA), with a relative density of 1.07gcm−3 is obtained containing 43wt% of spherical polymer particles with an average diameter of (145±11)nm (determined by light scattering). The glass transition temperature of P(S-BuA) was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and found to be 266K.']], ['Composite processing', ['The latex was first stirred with the stable aqueous suspensions of nanofillers. Two methods were then used for the composite processing. The mixture was either cast in an aluminum mold with a teflon coating and put in a drying oven at 35°C under vacuum for five days to allow slow water evaporation and film formation (i.e. polymer particles coalescence). So-called evaporated films (or materials E) were obtained. For the second process used to elaborate composites, the suspension mixture was first freeze-dried to allow water sublimation, and a compact soft powder was obtained. This powder was then pressed at 100°C for 5min under 1MPa after 45min of thermal stabilization without pressure. This second type of nanocomposite materials is referred as FP materials.', 'Samples reinforced with nanofillers contents of up to 6vol% for cellulosic nanofibrils and up to 3vol% for MWNTs fillers, were processed.']]]]]
