['Bisphenol A based epoxides are used in applications ranging from electric insulators to adhesives to composite resins [bib5 bib6 bib7]. Like other thermosetting materials, however, they are brittle. Therefore, micron-sized fillers have been added to epoxy resin to form composites with a better combination of mechanical, thermal and electrical properties [bib8]. Toughening epoxy by soft particles, such as rubber, is widely used [bib9 bib10 bib11], but reduces the stiffness of the epoxy. Rigid particles have also been used to improve the stiffness of epoxy. The limitation of such fillers is that they cause a decrease in ductility and opacity [bib12]. Recently, nanoscale fillers have been used to try to overcome these limitations [bib13]. The small particle size leads to smaller defects and increases particle/matrix interfacial area which provides and opportunity to tailor composite properties, even at a rather low filler loading [bib14 bib15 bib16]. Ash et al. [bib1] report that at an optimum weight fraction, the nanosized alumina filled PMMA composites display a room-temperature brittle-to-ductile transition in uniaxial tension with an increase in the strain-to-failure that averages 40% strain. Kinloch et al. [bib2 bib3 bib4] observed a doubling of the fracture toughness in nanosilica filled epoxy nanocomposites.', 'There are a set of models that address mechanisms leading to enhanced ductility when either rubber particles or rigid particles are used as fillers, including crack deflection theory by Faber and Evans [bib17 bib18], and by Spanoudakis and Young [bib19 bib20]; crack pinning theory by Lange [bib21], Evans [bib22], and Green et al. [bib23]; debonding theory by Evans et al. [bib24]; plastic void growth theory by Huang and Kinloch [bib11 bib4]; and particle pull-out and microcracking. This paper attempts to clarify the mechanisms operating in nanofilled epoxy; and in the discussion section, a quantitative comparison of our results with the theories suggests that the operative mechanisms are interface dependent.', ['Crack deflection', ['Crack deflection causes an increase in the total fracture surface area and therefore absorbs more energy compared to unfilled polymer materials. This increase in area can be evaluated by measuring the fracture surface roughness [bib27]. Crack deflection also causes the crack to grow locally under mixed-mode I/II or I/III conditions, the impact of which of toughness can be evaluated by Faber and Evans’s crack deflection theory [bib17 bib18]. A lower bound toughness increment is believed to result from the increase in surface area according to [bib17]\n                        \n                           \n

The debonding of the particles enables local plastic void growth to occur. In a tensile test, the area under stress–strain curve, <i>W</i>, is also known as the stored strain–energy density [bib25 bib26]. Huang and Kinloch [bib11] developed a model using strain–energy density to confirm whether plastic void growth could be responsible for toughening. This model assumes linear elastic behavior, and that the energy dissipation is localized to a small plastic zone at the crack tip. The contribution to the increase in strain–energy density, characterized by the area under stress–strain curve, from the plastic void growth mechanism is given by [bib11]\n                        \n                           \n                              (4)\n                              \n                                 Δ\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       W\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       v\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                 =\n                                 \n                                 0.5\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       σ\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       yt\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       V\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       v\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 -\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       V\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       f\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                                 ,\n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>V</i>\n                        v is the volume fraction of voids, <i>V</i>\n                        f is the volume fraction of particles, <i>σ</i>\n                        yt is the tensile yield stress (the stress at the maximum on stress–strain curve [bib5]) of the unmodified epoxy polymer.']], ['Particle pull-out and microcracking', ['Particle pull-out is due to the debonding of the nanoparticles and therefore will not be considered as an independent mechanism. Microcracks can be initiated due to the interaction of the crack front and the particles [bib28]. The main crack then deflects toward microcracks around the particle. Linkage of the main crack with the microcracks increases the total crack length and therefore, the energy absorbed.']]]
