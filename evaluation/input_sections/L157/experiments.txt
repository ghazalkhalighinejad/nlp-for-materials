[['Materials', ['Huntsman Araldite® epoxy was chosen as the thermosetting matrix polymer, including (i) Araldite F – bisphenol A liquid epoxy resin; (ii) Aradur HY905 – modified dicarboxylic anhydride hardener; (iii) DY062 – amine catalyst. The mixing ratio of epoxy resin to hardener was 1:1 by weight. NanoTek® aluminum oxide (Al2O3) was purchased from Nanophase Technologies Corporation, with an average particle size of 45nm (determined from specific surface area). 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) from Gelest Inc. was chosen to functionalize the alumina nanoparticles. The hypothesis was that the amino groups would react with the epoxy and the silane groups with the alumina surface, thus creating a relatively strong nanoparticle/epoxy interface.']], ['Silane surface treatment', ['The alumina nanoparticle surface treatment procedure was: (i) addition of 1g of Al2O3 to 50ml of 95% ethanol; (ii) sonication of the mixture for 5min using a wand at 1min intervals; (iii) addition of 1.5g APTES ((C2H5O)3Si–CH2–CH2–CH2–NH2) and sonication of the mixture for another 10min; (iv) refluxing the mixture for 3days at 80°C in an oil bath; (v) centrifuging and washing the nanoparticles with ethanol and hexane to remove the byproducts and extra silane followed by drying of the particles in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24h.']], ['Nanocomposites preparation', ['NT-Al2O3 (non-treated alumina) and APTES–Al2O3 (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane treated alumina) filled epoxy nanocomposites with 5, 10, 15 and 20phr (phr – per hundred gram resin) nanoparticle concentrations were prepared. Before using, the NT-Al2O3 nanoparticles were dried in vacuum at 190°C for 24h. Three steps were used to prepare the nanocomposites. First, the nanoparticles were dispersed in the liquid epoxy resin (Araldite F) to prepare a “masterbatch”. A well-dispersed masterbatch was achieved by shear mixing at 3450rpm for 20min using a Hauschild SpeedMixer® (DAC-150). Because the surface modified Al2O3 nanoparticles aggregate easily after the centrifuging and drying processes, for the APTES–Al2O3 nanocomposites, the dispersion was improved by adding 1/8” alumina balls during mixing. The balls were removed before curing. Second, the hardener (Aradur HY905) and catalyst (DY062) were added as per composition requirements into the masterbatch. Third, the mixture was mixed, degassed at room temperature, cured at 80°C for 6h, and post-cured at 135°C for 10h. Neat polymer samples were made to compare with the nanocomposites. Silicone rubber molds were used to prepare the test samples.']], ['Characterization', ['Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA® Instruments model Q50 TGA in N2 for both treated and untreated nanoparticles to determine the surface coverage of the silane coupling agent on the nanoparticles. A 10–50mg sample was heated from 25°C to 900°C with a constant heating rate of 10°C/min. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 4700 FT-IR spectrometer in transmission mode. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) model Q100 from TA® Instruments was used to check the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                        g) to ensure complete curing. The samples were heated from 25°C to 160°C with a constant heating rate of 10°C/min. Data obtained from the second heating run were used, and at least three samples were tested for each material.']], ['Tensile tests\n                     ', ['Tensile tests were performed on an Instron 4204 tensile test machine with a constant loading speed of 0.1mm/min according to ASTM D638. The stress–strain curves of the materials were obtained, and Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength, strain-to-break, and area under stress–strain curve were measured. At least eight samples were tested for each condition. The dog-bone tensile test samples with 3×3mm cross-section were molded from silicone rubber molds and polished on both sides before loading.']], ['Fracture surface properties', ['Surface roughness of tensile fracture surfaces were measured at the University of Florida using a Dektak® 8 Advanced Development Profiler from Veeco Instruments Inc. 2D scans were performed by this stylus profilometer with a 12.5μm needle. At least 10 scan were performed for each material at different positions and the average roughness was calculated using Dektak® 8 software. A JEOL 6330F field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a JEOL CM12 transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to observe the dispersion of nanoparticles and morphology of fracture surfaces of the tensile test samples.']]]
