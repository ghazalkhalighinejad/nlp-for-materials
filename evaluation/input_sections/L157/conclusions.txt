['APTES silane graft Al2O3 nanoparticles were prepared by solution treatment. The tensile properties of well-dispersed NT-Al2O3 and APTES–Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites with different nanoparticle loadings were measured. There was no change in the glass transition temperature for most of the nanocomposites. APTES–Al2O3 nanoparticle filled epoxy showed significant increases in strain-to-break (39% at 10phr particle loading) while exhibiting an increase in modulus and maintained strength. The toughening mechanisms including crack deflection, debonding and plastic deformation of the debonded matrix (plastic void growth) work for both untreated and treated nanocomposites. However, further crack deflection and microcracking are the mechanisms distinctively for the treated nanocomposites.']
