[['SWCNT/epoxy nanocomposites', ["SWCNTs agglomerates of ropes (diameter of about 12nm) are present and uniformly dispersed into the LY 564 epoxy specimens, as observed by optical and high resolution scanning electron microscopy observations. The same is true for the Epon 815 epoxy specimens although the dispersion of the agglomerates was somewhat less uniform. The storage modulus and tan\n                        <i>δ</i> are presented in [fig1]\n                         as a function of temperature and of CNT content (0.01 and 0.05wt%), for both epoxies. Below 50°C the storage modulus of the LY 564-based composites increases by a few percent relative to the pure epoxy ([fig1](a)). In parallel, a decrease of the tan <i>δ</i> peak height is observed with increasing nanotube content ([fig1](b)). A similar picture emerges for the Epon 815 composites ([fig1](c and d)), although the absolute values of tan <i>δ</i> are higher for Epon 815 (about 0.9) than for LY 564 (about 0.6), and the decrease in peak height maximum for the Epon 815 nanocomposites is proportionally smaller than for the LY 564 nanocomposites. To clarify these results, a plot of the normalized modulus at room temperature against CNT content is presented in [fig2]\n                         for both types of composites. A comparison is made with a Rule-of-Mixture (RoM) type prediction of the modulus <i>E</i> (based on Krenchel's model for 3-dimensional randomly dispersed short-fiber composites [bib19 bib21]):\n                           \n                              (1)\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       E\n                                       C\n                                    \n                                    =\n                                    η\n                                    \n                                       E\n                                       \n                                          NT\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    \n                                       V\n                                       \n                                          NT\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    +\n                                    \n                                       E\n                                       m\n                                    \n                                    (\n                                    1\n                                    −\n                                    \n                                       V\n                                       \n                                          NT\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    )\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>V</i> is the volume fraction (the subscripts C, NT and m denote composite, nanotube and matrix, respectively), and <i>η</i> is Krenchel's coefficient which, for 3D randomly oriented rods, is 0.2 [bib19 bib20]. For convenience, the assumed nanotube modulus used in Eq. [fd1] was 1TPa for both tube types.

We used <i>ρ</i>\n                        NT=1.4g/cm3 for SWCNTs [bib9] and 1.72g/cm3 for MWCNTs (average value from calculations, see Eq. (14) in Ref. [bib21]) respectively, and 1.2 and 1.1g/cm3 for the LY 564 and Epon 815 matrices, respectively. The experimental modulus (at 20°C) of SWCNT/LY564 nanocomposites increases slightly faster with CNT content than predicted by the RoM. It is also seen that, for 0.05wt% SWCNT/Epon 815 nanocomposites, an 8% modulus increase is measured relative to the polymer. Such modulus increases at very low nanotube loadings suggest that the load is transferred efficiently from the matrix to the SWCNTs, with the obvious implications regarding interfacial adhesion. Note that only slight variations in <i>T</i>\n                        g were observed for both types of SWCNT-based nanocomposites, as a function of tube content, see [fig3]\n                        .", 'A substantial increase in tensile impact strength was measured ([fig4]\n                        ), relative to the pure matrices. The improvement ranges between 18 and 35%, respectively, for both resins, within the 0.01–0.05wt fraction span. High resolution SEM micrographs of pure epoxy and of SWNT/epoxy composites after impact did not reveal anything unforeseen, namely, pure epoxy fracture surfaces were glassy-like whereas the nanocomposite fracture surfaces were rougher in appearance (more so for SWCNT/LY564 than for SWCNT/Epon815). The increase in impact strength (and thus, possibly, of toughness) may be explained by the presence of cavities bridged by nanotube ropes (mainly in the SWCNT/LY564 composites), which leads to energy dissipation by nanotube pull-out. Note also that such ropes are observed (using high resolution SEM) to be well wetted by epoxy, as in our earlier TEM work using SWCNT/LY564 films [bib14 bib22]. An additional contribution to energy dissipation arises from the crack deflection at agglomerates.']], ['MWCNT/epoxy nanocomposites', ['The quality of the dispersion of MWCNTs in epoxy was similar to that of SWCNTs in epoxy, with again the dispersion in Epon 815 being slightly less uniform than in LY564. Also, the variation of the storage modulus of both types of MWCNT-based composites ([fig5]\n                        ) with increasing tube content, is generally the same as for SWCNT-based composites. A plot of the normalized (room temperature) modulus against nanotube content is presented in [fig6]\n                        , for both types of epoxy-based composites. The complex composite modulus lies above the matrix modulus at all nanotube contents. As before, the modulus at 0.05wt% MWCNT is higher than the Rule of Mixtures prediction. However, at 0.5wt% MWCNTs, the modulus is lower than the RoM prediction, perhaps due to less than ideal properties of the MWCNTs and to the possible relative slippage (telescopic behavior) of the shells in multi-walled nanotubes [bib14 bib16 bib22], which would lead to poor load transfer in tension [bib14]. Finally, as before with SWCNT systems, the absolute values of tan\n                        <i>δ</i> (about 0.9) are higher for the Epon 815 system than for the LY 564 system (about 0.6).', 'A significant reduction in glass transition temperature is observed in the tan\n                        <i>δ</i> plots for 0.5wt% MWCNT/LY564 nanocomposites. This is made more evident by plotting <i>T</i>\n                        g against tube content, in [fig7]\n                        . By contrast, the Epon 815 system shows no change in <i>T</i>\n                        g.', "The tensile impact strength results are presented in [fig8]\n                        . As with SWCNT systems, a substantial impact resistance arises with respect to the pure matrices for the LY 564 system: up to 70% when using 0.5wt% MWCNTs, and up to 50% when using 0.05% MWCNTs. The Epon 815 system is much less impact-performant. As with SWCNTs composites, nanocomposite fracture surfaces generally appear to be rather rough in the SEM, more so for MWCNT/LY564 than for MWCNT/Epon815. Enhanced toughness in the LY 564 system is explained as before by the good dispersion clearly seen in the SEM ([fig9]\n                        ) and the good wetting of the tubes by the matrix. Note that the possibility of enhanced toughness of samples due to residual SDS surfactant and solvent was readily rejected. Indeed, separate measurements using pure resin, and pure resin with solvents/surfactants similar to the specimens containing nanotubes, were also prepared and tested. Their static mechanical properties (such as Young's modulus) showed no change compared to the neat resin. If solvent/surfactant had remained in the system, a decrease of Young's modulus or tensile strength would certainly have been observed, which was not the case. Note also that the amount of SDS surfactant in the matrix system was only about 0.2wt%.", 'It is interesting to notice that for the LY564 systems (with both SWCNT and MWCNT) the glass transition temperature decreases as more nanotubes are present ([fig3 fig7]), most likely because these reduce the crosslinking tendency of the resin. This is also reflected by the shoulder in the tan(<i>δ</i>) that appears when nanotubes are added ([fig1 fig5]), and can be correlated with the impact strength increase as well ([fig4 fig8]). Very little of this is seen with the Epon system, however.', 'We might ask—a posteriori—whether the aspect ratio <i>L</i>/<i>D</i>\n                        NT (<i>L</i> is the tube length, <i>D</i>\n                        NT is its external diameter) of carbon nanotubes (both SWNT and MWNT) is, in fact, large enough to allow sufficient stress transfer and, thus, to permit full exploitation of the nanotubes mechanical potential. The experimentally observed aspect ratios of SWCNTs and MWCNTs are, respectively, 500–1400 and 50–500. According to a simple model [bib23], the nanotubes are able to reach their maximum tensile strength under tension when the aspect ratio is at least equal to\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       L\n                                       \n                                          \n                                             D\n                                             \n                                                NT\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                    =\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             σ\n                                             \n                                                NT\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                       \n                                          2\n                                          \n                                             τ\n                                             \n                                                NT\n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                    \n                                       (\n                                       \n                                          1\n                                          −\n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   d\n                                                   \n                                                      NT\n                                                   \n                                                   2\n                                                \n                                             \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   D\n                                                   \n                                                      NT\n                                                   \n                                                   2\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                       \n                                       )\n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>σ</i>\n                        NT is the maximum strength of the tube, <i>τ</i>\n                        NT is the interfacial shear strength between the nanotube and the polymer matrix, and <i>d</i>\n                        NT is the internal diameter of the tube. For SWCNTs, using the conservative estimates <i>σ</i>\n                        NT=50GPa [bib24 bib25] and <i>τ</i>\n                        NT=35–200MPa [bib25 bib26], <i>d</i>\n                        NT=0.81nm, and <i>D</i>\n                        NT=<i>d</i>\n                        NT+0.68nm, the aspect ratio range calculated from the expression above is 120–700. Similarly, for MWCNTs, using a tube length of 1–5μm, an external diameter of 30–40nm, and an assumed internal diameter of 20nm, the aspect ratio range calculated from the expression above is 70–625. Thus for both SWCNTs and MWCNTs, the experimentally observed aspect ratios are sufficiently large (compared to the range of calculated values) to enable efficient stress transfer. Finally, note that fracture toughness increases have also been recently observed in double-walled carbon nanotube-based composites [bib27].']]]
