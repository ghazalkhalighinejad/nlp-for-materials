Thermo-mechanical properties of randomly oriented carbon/epoxy nanocomposites
The thermo-mechanical properties of epoxy-based nanocomposites based on low weight fractions (from 0.01 to 0.5wt%) of randomly oriented single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were examined. Preparation methods for the nanocomposites, using two types of epoxy resins, were developed and good dispersion was generally achieved. The mechanical properties examined were the tensile Young's modulus by Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis and the toughness under tensile impact using notched specimens. Moderate Young's modulus improvements of nanocomposites were observed with respect to the pure matrix material. A particularly significant enhancement of the tensile impact toughness was obtained for specific nanocomposites, using only minute nanotube weight fractions. No significant change in the glass transition temperature of SWCNT/epoxy nanocomposites was observed, compared to that of the epoxy matrix. The elastic modulus of the SWNT-based nanocomposites was found to be slightly higher than the value predicted by the Krenchel model for short-fiber composites with random orientation.
