['The dynamic mechanical behavior and tensile impact properties of epoxy-based nanocomposites containing low weight fractions of MWCNTs and SWCNTs were studied. Satisfactory nanotube dispersion was achieved for both types of nanotubes into epoxy resins in the 0.01â€“0.5wt% range. Improvements in complex modulus were obtained relative to the polymer matrix. Generally better damping properties are observed for Epon 815 and its composites compared with LY564 and its composites. A particularly significant improvement (70% reinforcement) in tensile impact strength was obtained for the 0.5wt% MWCNT/LY564 system. A simple calculation shows that the range of aspect ratios used here for both SWCNT and MWCNT enables efficient stress transfer, and thus permits the full exploitation of the nanotubes mechanical potential.']
