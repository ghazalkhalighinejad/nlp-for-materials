[['Nanotubes and polymer matrices', ['The carbon nanotubes were (1) HiPCO SWCNTs (CNI Houston) with a length in the micron range and a diameter of 0.8–1.0nm and (2) MWCNTs produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (Nanolab), with nominal purity of 95%, length of 1–5μm, external diameter of 30–40nm and interlayer distance of 3.315Å. For details, see [bib9]. Two types of epoxy resins were used: (1) LY 564 (Ciba-Geigy, Switzerland, hardener: HY 560) and (2) Epon 815 (Huntsman Corporation, Texas, hardener: JeffamineR T-403 polyetheramine). Both resins have low processing viscosity and good overall mechanical properties for composite applications.']], ['Nanocomposite preparation', [['Preparation of pure resin specimens', ['LY 564 epoxy and HY560 hardener (weight ratio 100/27) were thoroughly mixed and put under vacuum for 35–40min to remove air bubbles, then cast into a RTV mold and cured at 80°C for 10h. The Epon 815/T-403 specimens were prepared similarly (weight ratio 100/43), but with the following curing schedule: 2h at 80°C followed by 3h at 125°C.']], ['Preparation of nanocomposites', ['A small amount (5–6mg) of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant was dissolved in about 1mL of ethanol and two weight percentages (0.01 and 0.05) of SWCNTs were added to each of the solutions. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used for the preparation of suspensions of MWCNTs. Homogeneous suspensions were prepared using a high intensity sonicator (at 20% amplitude for 2min) and a sonic bath (for 1h). Each nanotube suspension was then added to an epoxy resin (2g) and the components were mixed again using the high intensity sonicator (at 50% amplitude for 4min). The mixtures were left overnight at 45°C, followed by 1h in vacuum, to evaporate the solvent. The hardener was then added (LY 564/HY 560 epoxy mixed in a 100:27 ratio, and Epon 815/T-403 epoxy mixed in a 100:43 ratio, respectively) and mechanically mixed with the epoxy/nanotube mixtures. These mixtures were returned to vacuum for 35–40min (for LY564/HY560) or 90–100min (for Epon 815/T-403), respectively, to remove any air trapped during mixing, and to ensure homogeneity. The mixtures were then cast into a rectangular RTV mold (50mm×5mm×0.8mm3) and cured at 80°C for 10h (for LY564/HY560) or left at room temperature for 24h and then cured at 80°C for 2h and 125°C for 3h (for Epon 815/T-403). These methods produced non-porous composites with good nanotube dispersion, as observed using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30, The Netherlands). A thin layer (about 3nm) of chromium was sputter-coated on the SEM specimens, which were mounted onto a standard SEM holder with conducting carbon tape.']]]], ['Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA)', ['Tensile DMTA tests were performed to generate thermo-mechanical data for the nanocomposites. An ‘EPLEXOR 500 N’ apparatus (GABO, Germany) was employed for those tests, using 50×5×0.8mm3 specimens. The samples were tested in the 0–130°C temperature range, at a heating rate of 3°C/min in air and at a frequency of 10Hz. The storage modulus (<i>E</i>′), complex modulus (<i>E</i>*) and the loss tangent (tan <i>δ</i>) were determined as a function of temperature. Three specimens were tested for each type of material (LY564 and Epon 815 and their nanocomposites). The specimen-to-specimen variation of the storage modulus was generally very small (of the order of ±0.38% for LY564 and of ±1.3% for Epon 815).']], ['Impact tests', ['Impact tests were performed in tension with double-notched specimens, using a Zwick Impact Testing apparatus. The specimen thickness was 0.22mm, the width 3mm, and the gauge length used was 20mm (total specimen length was 30mm). Two 0.4mm deep V-shaped notches were machined on both sides of the specimen width. A 0.5J pendulum and test piece yoke of 15g were used for impact.']]]
