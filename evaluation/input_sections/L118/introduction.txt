["The discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [bib1] and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) [bib2] has generated new perspectives in many fields of science and technology [bib3 bib4]. Due to their structure (they consist of tiny concentric graphene cylinders), these novel forms of crystalline carbon possess an outstanding combination of electrical, thermal and mechanical properties [bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10]. Their extremely high strength to weight ratio [bib7], a very high Young's modulus in the TPa range [bib8 bib10], and high flexibility and toughness [bib10 bib11], make them a candidate material for future reinforced polymer matrix composites. Their mechanical properties (especially tensile strength) considerably exceed those of currently available fiber materials (graphite, Kevlar, stainless steel, â€¦) [bib12]. To take full advantage of these unique mechanical properties, optimization of nanotube-polymer interface properties (such as wettability [bib13] and adhesion [bib14]) is required. For tensile stiffness and strength, wetting and adhesion (via chemical bonding between the nanotubes and polymer) are necessary for the efficient transfer of stress to the nanotubes [bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16], whereas for toughness, some slippage between nanotubes and the matrix (thus, relatively lower adhesion) might be desirable to capitalize on the flexibility and toughness characteristics of the nanotubes. Also, due to the high aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes (CNT), large interfacial areas are available for stress transfer. However, the large contact areas between carbon nanotubes and the relatively strong inter-tube attraction via van der Waal's forces (especially in SWCNTs [bib17]) create difficulties during their incorporation into polymers: the nanotubes spontaneously bundle together, which makes their dispersion more difficult, leading to a drastic decrease in the strength of nanocomposites. High-quality dispersion of nanotubes in polymer composites is, therefore, imperative for efficient structural reinforcement. Note also that small amounts of CNT spread into a polymer have been shown to affect the electrical properties (conductivity), and the thermal resistance, of nanotube-based composites [bib6 bib18].", 'The focus of this work is to develop preparation methods to effectively disperse carbon nanotubes into an epoxy matrix, and to improve the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites. We examine specific elastic and fracture properties of two types of epoxy resins in which two types of well-dispersed low weight fractions of carbon nanotubes were incorporated.']
