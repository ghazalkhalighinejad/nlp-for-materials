[['Materials', ['Two high-performance epoxy systems were used as the matrix phase in CFRPs. The “base” system consisted of a high-viscosity tetrafunctional resin (tetraglycidyl 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane, Araldite MY721, Huntsman) cured with a diamine hardener (diaminodiphenyl sulfone, DDS, Aradur 976, Huntsman) at a 100:44 ratio by weight, as recommended by the manufacturer. The cured network results in an exceptionally high crosslink density and thus a low molecular weight between crosslinks (<i>M</i>c\n                        \n                        ∼175g/mol). The ‘toughened’ epoxy system was prepared with 5phr (parts per hundred resin by weight) of a commercial triblock copolymer (M52N, Arkema) containing midblocks of <i>n</i>-butyl acrylate with symmetrical endblocks of random copolymers of methyl methacrylate and N,N′-dimethylacrylamide. The triblock copolymer molecular weight is 36kg/mol with 18kg/mol midblocks. Carbon nanofibers (GANF1, Grupo Antolín Ingeniería) produced by Ni-catalyzed carbon vapor deposition with 20–200nm diameters, 1–6μm lengths, and ∼35:1 aspect ratio were used as received [b0125]. CNFs were incorporated at 0, 1, and 3phr (0, 0.69, and 2.0wt.%) in the base system and 0 and 1phr (0 and 0.67wt.%) in the toughened system, as summarized in [t0005]\n                        .']], ['Sample preparation', ['CNFs were dispersed in the base epoxy systems (<i>i.e</i>. composites without TCP) by shear mixing in order to take advantage of the epoxy precursor viscosity in shearing apart CNF bundles. First, the resin was heated to ∼135°C, and the hardener was slowly added while stirring until dissolved. The mixture was allowed to cool to ∼80°C, and the appropriate amount of CNFs were hand mixed. The mixture was mechanically mixed using a shear mixer at 7000rpm for 2min, followed by degassing under 29.4″ Hg of vacuum at 80°C until all gas was removed. The short duration of shear mixing was used in order to minimize shortening of the CNFs [b0090].', 'CNFs were dispersed in the toughened epoxy systems (<i>i.e</i>. composites with 5phr TCP) by solution processing, as is commonly employed for composites based on epoxy with block copolymer or CNF reinforcement [b0030 b0090 b0110]. First, the resin, hardener, and triblock copolymer were all dissolved in acetone in a round-bottom flask. The desired amounts of CNFs were suspended in acetone in 40-mL vials at a concentration of 15mg/mL and were bath sonicated for 1h to disperse the nanofibers. Following sonication, the CNF suspensions were poured into the epoxy-TCP solution, followed by 1h of additional bath sonication. Then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, followed by degassing under 29.4″ Hg of vacuum at 80°C until all gas was removed.', 'These epoxy precursors were used to prepare carbon-fiber prepregs (65wt.% CF) containing continuous PAN-based carbon fibers with 7μm diameter (AS4GP, Hexcel) at a fiber areal weight of 190g/m2, which were subsequently laid up by hand in both unidirectional [0]16 and quasi-isotropic [+45/0/−45/90]2\n                        <i>\n                           </i>s\n                         configurations. These lay-ups were then cured using a press-clave [b0145]. The curing temperature was increased at a rate of 0.83°Cmin−1 (∼1.5°F/min) from room temperature to 177°C, followed by a 2h hold at the final temperature. Curing was done under 610mm Hg (24″ Hg) of vacuum and 5.1atm (75psi) of pressure below and above the gel point, respectively. Finally, each composite was postcured at 180°C for 4h at atmospheric pressure.']], ['Characterization of composites', ['Several techniques were implemented to characterize the resulting composites, as summarized in detail in [t0010]\n                        . All mechanical testing was carried out using an MTS-6 universal testing machine. Tensile modulus, strength, and strain to failure were determined by tensile testing of 0.5in.×7.5in. specimens with 1-in. tabs using wedge grips and a 200-kN load cell. Tensile strain was measured using an extensometer with a 1-in. gauge length. Short beam shear strength was obtained by three-point bending of rectangular specimens using an 8kN load cell. Open-hole compressive strength was obtained by open-hole compression (OHC) of specimens with dimensions of 1.5in.×5in. OHC specimens were prepared by drilling 0.25-in. diameter holes in the center through the thickness with a diamond-coated drill bit, and subsequent compression testing was done using a 200kN load cell with a compression fixture as described by Bardis et al. [b0150]. Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness was determined by mode I opening of double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens measuring 1in.×7.5in. using a 50-lb load cell. For DCB testing, a 50-μm thick Teflon film inserted in the midplane during prepreg lay-up acted as a crack starter. The interlaminar fracture toughness, <i>G</i>Ic\n                        , was determined using modified beam theory with tilt correction, according to ASTM D 5528. Transverse electrical conductivity was determined using alternating current impedance spectroscopy on polished specimens, as described elsewhere [b0140]. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was performed on unidirectional composite specimens using an RSA3 (TA Instruments) in three-point bending with a 40-mm span. Temperature ramps were carried out from 30°C to 320°C at a heating rate of 3°Cmin−1 with 0.1% strain amplitude and 1Hz frequency. DMTA specimens with cross sections of ∼2mm×3mm and a length of ∼50mm were machined using a precision diamond saw. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of delaminated fracture surfaces using a LEO Gemini 1525 SEM at a high voltage of 3kV and a working distance of 5mm was implemented to determine the morphology of the nanostructured phases, as well as to gain insight into the mechanisms behind the observed mechanical reinforcement. Transmission electron microscopy on carbon nanofibers dispersed on a copper grid was carried out using a JEOL JEM-2100F FAST TEM at an accelerating voltage of 200kV.']]]
