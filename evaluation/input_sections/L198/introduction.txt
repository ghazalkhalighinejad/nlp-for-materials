['Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) are characterized by low weight, high strength and stiffness, and low coefficients of thermal expansion in the fiber direction, making them attractive in a wide variety of applications in wind energy, transportation, aerospace design, and sporting equipment, among others. Superior strength-to-weight ratios are a primary motivational factor for the incorporation of CFRPs [b0005], but these composite materials can also be designed with multifunctionality, replacing non-structural elements while enhancing structural integrity.', 'High-performance composite systems often incorporate highly crosslinked epoxy adhesives to hold together the load-bearing carbon fibers. These glassy networks offer high creep and corrosion resistance, good adhesion to carbon fibers, and high working temperatures as determined by their high glass transition temperatures (<i>T</i>g\n                     ), yet they are also highly brittle and insulating [b0010]. As a result, CFRPs suffer from poor matrix-dominated mechanical properties such as interlaminar fracture toughness and transverse electrical and thermal conductivity, particularly in matrix-rich interlaminar regions between carbon fibers.', 'Thus, many studies have focused on toughening the matrix component of CFRPs to improve their mechanical robustness. Rubber-toughening through the addition of discrete rubber particles enhances toughness but also degrades the thermomechanical properties of crosslinked polymer networks [b0015 b0020]. Amphiphilic block copolymers undergo reaction induced phase separation (RIPS) during the curing process to yield similar rubbery domains that are anchored into the matrix by epoxy-miscible blocks, providing similar toughening with reduced degradation in thermomechanical properties due to control over morphology [b0025 b0030]. The addition of a rigid thermoplastic is another effective method of toughening with low degradation in the thermomechanical properties of the matrix [b0035 b0040 b0045]. While these approaches have been partially successful, new strategies to improve toughness while maintaining or improving thermal properties and simultaneously addressing additional needs such as transverse electrical conductivity are needed.', 'In this light, nanoparticles have the potential to toughen the matrix phase and offer the added benefit of multifunctionality for simultaneous enhancements in other properties. For example, clay nanoplatelets offer enhanced flexural modulus and barrier properties [b0050 b0055]. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) enable enhanced health monitoring and improved mechanical, electrical and thermal properties in traditional fiber-reinforced systems [b0060 b0065 b0070 b0075 b0080]. Cho et al. reported an increase in interlaminar fracture toughness of ∼15% with 0.5wt.% CNTs [b0080]. Bekyarova et al. grew CNTs on carbon fiber surfaces for enhanced interactions, yielding tensile modulus and strength improvements of ∼30% and 15% over the base composites, respectively [b0075]. Veedu et al. grew CNTs on SiC fiber surfaces by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and found enhancements in interlaminar fracture toughness of ∼386% (CNT content unknown) [b0065]. Unfortunately, CNT growth from carbon fibers often results in non-uniform coverage or damage to the carbon fibers, making this method difficult to optimize for CFRPs [b0085]. Furthermore, a major limitation of this “hybrid” approach to composites containing both microscale carbon fibers and nanoparticles is the high expense associated with many nanoparticles.', 'Thus, carbon nanofibers (CNF), which offer a good compromise between performance and cost compared with CNTs [b0090 b0095], are an ideal candidate for incorporation into CFRPs. Previous studies have shown good promise, with a 100% increase in mode I interlaminar fracture toughness at only 1wt.% CNF, as reported by Tsantzalis et al. [b0100]. An increase of up to ∼160% in mode I interlaminar fracture toughness was observed by Yokozeki et al. through a combination of an epoxy phase with 5wt.% CNFs and a CNF-rich film in the region of crack propagation [b0105]. Still, there have been limited studies on hybrid composites containing CNFs, particularly on systems incorporating high-performance epoxies (<i>T</i>g\n                     \n                     >250°C), which are particularly difficult to toughen in light of their exceptionally high crosslink densities [b0110].', 'CNFs and CNTs are both composed of graphene sheets, yielding similar electrical and thermal properties [b0115 b0120]. However, the stacked-cup structure of CNFs entails graphitic stacking of helically coiled graphene sheets or ribbons oriented at an angle with respect to the nanofiber axis ([f0005]\n                     ) [b0125 b0130 b0135]. This unique structure enables failure modes such as unraveling or splaying of the coiled graphitic sheets, which offer new pathways for toughening of nanostructured composite systems [b0140].', 'In this study, we have investigated the influence of various amounts of stacked-cup carbon nanofibers in “hybrid” composite systems containing both micro- and nano-scale carbon fibers. The matrix phase in the composite systems under study consisted of either a “base” high-performance epoxy or the same epoxy “toughened” with 5phr (parts per hundred resin by weight) of a commercial elastomeric triblock copolymer (TCP) in order to determine the effect of a second polymer phase in the matrix component of these hybrid composites and to take advantage of synergistic toughening of the epoxy matrix. The resultant composites were characterized mechanically and electrically in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy to understand the interactions between the reinforcing phases and their influence on macroscopic properties.']
