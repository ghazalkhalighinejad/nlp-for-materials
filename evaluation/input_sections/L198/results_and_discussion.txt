[['Stiffness/strength characterization of hybrid composites', ['The most attractive aspect of continuous-fiber composites as structural materials is their tensile properties, due to the high strength and modulus of the load-bearing fibers. [f0010]\n                         shows the tensile properties as a function of CNF content for both the base and toughened composite systems, as indicated by the blue and red bars, respectively. The failure behavior is only presented for quasi-isotropic composites due to inconsistent failure modes (<i>e.g</i>. premature failure at the tabs) in unidirectional composites. [f0010]a presents the Young’s modulus for the unidirectional composites, showing no significant change through the addition of either CNFs or TCP since the alignment of the carbon fibers with the testing direction yields a fiber-dominated response with very limited influence of matrix-phase reinforcements. Thus, most of the unidirectional composites are well described by the rule of mixtures, which is almost flat as a function of CNF content at the low loadings used in this study. However, the simultaneous addition of both CNFs and TCP degrades the modulus by about 7%, which may be due to agglomerated CNFs reducing the efficiency of stress transfer or to morphological changes in the TCP domains induced by the CNFs, as discussed in Section [s0045].', 'In contrast, the quasi-isotropic composite moduli shown in [f0010]b reveal a dependence on both of the matrix-phase reinforcements because the misalignment of the carbon fibers in most of the plies with the testing direction imparts an increased influence of the matrix phase. A modest degradation of modulus is observed through the incorporation of the elastomeric triblock copolymer in the toughened systems, yet an enhancement of ∼10% is observed in both the base and toughened systems with 1phr CNF. A plateau is observed at 3phr CNF, likely due to agglomeration as described below. [f0010]c indicates a modest reduction in strength accompanied by a modest increase in failure strain in the toughened system at a given CNF content, as expected for the addition of a softer, more compliant material in the matrix. Moreover, the incorporation of CNFs yields a modest strength enhancement without a reduction in failure strain, demonstrating an improvement in tensile toughness with CNFs.', 'Short beam shear tests of small rectangular specimens were performed to gain insight into the shear behavior of the composites, with the short beam strength presented in [f0015]\n                        a. Unidirectional composites failed in the matrix-rich regions by delamination between plies, yielding an interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), whereas quasi-isotropic composites failed by transverse cracking around carbon fibers misaligned with the testing span. Despite the different failure modes, both composite orientations exhibited enhanced strength – approximately 15% and 22% in the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites, respectively – with the addition of CNFs, with minimal degradation brought about by the incorporation of the weak triblock copolymer into the stiff matrix. It is worth noting that the 15% increase in ILSS is relative to a high baseline value of 115MPa in the unidirectional system.', '[f0015]b presents the results of open-hole compression tests on the quasi-isotropic composites. Even though some degradation in strength is observed in the toughened systems due to the weaker TCP dispersed in the matrix, this measure of strength is largely independent of CNF content. However, an increase is observed in the slope of the stress versus extension curves with CNF addition, again demonstrating the stiffening effect of the CNFs observed in [f0010]a.', 'In order to understand the mechanisms by which the matrix reinforcing phases influence the tensile and shear properties of the composites, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on delaminated surfaces. [f0020]\n                        a shows a delaminated surface of a neat (0phr CNF) base composite. Bare carbon fiber surfaces suggest that the interfaces between the matrix and fibers act as a weak point for crack propagation. Moreover, a mirror-like matrix-rich region is observed at the top of the image, illustrating highly brittle fracture of the matrix phase. However, the addition of CNFs to the matrix phase yields increased tortuosity in the fracture surface, indicating increased damage prior to failure ([f0020]b). Moreover, matrix-phase “sheaths” can be found surrounding the carbon fibers with the addition of either CNFs ([f0020]c) or TCP ([f0020]d), suggesting improved adhesion between the matrix and carbon fibers due to the complex interactions between the constituent phases. These enhanced interfacial interactions offset the degradation in matrix stiffness and strength induced by TCP domains, whereas CNFs can act as a more effective stress transfer medium between the carbon fibers, as well as sustain increased stress compared with the matrix, thereby enhancing the stiffness and strength of the composite systems.', 'Nonetheless, the large-scale CNF agglomeration at 3phr CNFs ([f0020]c, top) reduces the efficacy of CNF reinforcement due to stress concentrations in regions of clustered CNFs. Despite this agglomeration, enhancements by up to 200% are observed in the transverse electrical conductivity of the composites with the addition of CNFs ([f0025]\n                        ), as similarly observed by Bekyarova et al. by incorporating CNTs into CFRP systems [b0075]. Because of the anisotropy in carbon fiber electrical conductivity, as well as the insulating nature of the polymer adhesive, the transverse conductivity of CFRPs with continuous fibers is often significantly lower than the longitudinal conductivity. Thus, the conducting CNFs create a more robust electrical pathway in the transverse direction of the hybrid composites.']], ['Energy-dissipation by CNFs and TCP', ['For mode I opening of double cantilever beam laminate specimens, the interlaminar fracture toughness, <i>G</i>Ic\n                        , can be monitored as a function of crack growth for slow, stable crack growth. <i>R</i>-curve behavior is typically observed whereby <i>G</i>Ic\n                         increases during initial crack propagation due to fiber bridging or other toughening mechanisms until a steady state is reached for which <i>G</i>Ic\n                         becomes independent of crack growth. In the current experiments, however, initial crack growth typically proceeded in an unstable manner due to large matrix pockets in front of the Teflon films acting as precracks, thereby convoluting the analysis of initiation <i>G</i>Ic\n                         values. Nonetheless, the interlaminar fracture toughness of the unidirectional composites could still be found as a function of crack extension from the arrest position of the unstable cracks, as shown by representative curves in [f0030]\n                        a (Note: there is no <i>R</i>-curve corresponding to the toughened unidirectional composite with 1phr CNFs due to the absence of a Teflon film in the cured composite). Despite the initial instability, <i>R</i>-curve behavior was still observed in all composite systems, with increasing magnitude for the composites containing either CNFs or TCP, indicating toughening by both reinforcing phases in the matrix.', 'Even though initiation <i>G</i>Ic\n                         values could not be obtained as described above, the steady-state interlaminar fracture toughness of both the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites is shown in [f0030]b. It is worth noting that while transply failure is common in composites with plies of dissimilar orientation, the quasi-isotropic composites demonstrated crack growth through the midplane due to the alignment of the two center plies with the testing direction. In both orientations, the addition of TCP to the base system without CNFs resulted in an enhanced toughness between 25% and 50%, verifying the “toughened” nature of the TCP-modified systems brought about by the improved CF/matrix adhesion and plastic deformation of the rubbery TCP domains. The modest magnitude of these enhancements is consistent with reports indicating limited effectiveness of TCP-toughening for increasing crosslink density of epoxy systems [b0110]. The addition of 1phr CNFs also yields modest toughening, with enhancements of ∼10% and 20% in GIc in the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites, respectively. The lack of more significant toughening, as well as the disappearance of any toughening influence at 3phr CNFs, is most likely due to stress concentrations around agglomerated CNFs, which offset the energy-dissipative mechanisms brought about by stacked-cup CNFs as discussed elsewhere [b0140].', 'Despite the limitation in toughening caused by agglomeration, SEM analysis of fracture surfaces was implemented to investigate the toughening mechanisms imparted by the reinforcing phases. As noted above, the presence of CNFs in the matrix phase yields rougher surfaces than the mirror-like surfaces of neat epoxy-rich regions, indicating crack deflection around the CNFs ([f0020] b). Closer inspection reveals CNF pullout and rupture, with the former being more prevalent ([f0035]\n                        a). In addition, dangling sheets at the end of exposed CNF segments indicate overcoming of interlayer <i>π</i>–<i>π</i> interactions by unraveling of the coiled sheets, as observed previously [b0140]. [f0035]b shows a fracture surface of a toughened composite without CNFs, revealing 1–2μm domains of TCP with either spherical vesicle or salami-like domain morphologies [b0155 b0160]. The former consist of epoxy-rich cores surrounded by TCP-rich coronae, whereas the latter have smaller epoxy-rich domains in oblong TCP-rich domains. The interfacial regions between the matrix and TCP appear intact due to the anchoring effect of the epoxy-miscible endblocks, suggesting that they bridged the propagating crack, thereby dissipating energy by plastic deformation of the elastomeric phase as the crack faces separate. When CNFs are incorporated into the toughened system ([f0035]c), the TCP domains near CNF surfaces decrease in size by about an order of magnitude and take on a spherical micelle morphology. Both of these factors have been attributed to decreased effectiveness in toughening of block-copolymer-modified epoxy composites [b0160 b0165], which may be the primary source of the antagonistic response for the toughened composite with 1phr CNFs shown in [f0030]b. Finally, multiple segmental rupture is observed, likely due to local weakening of the CNF structure due to splaying [b0140].']], ['Glass transition temperature of hybrid composites', ['The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g\n                        ) of the unidirectional composite systems as determined by the peak in the loss tangent during a temperature ramp by DMTA is presented in [f0040]\n                        . The addition of a rubbery phase into epoxy systems often yields significant degradation in <i>T</i>g\n                         due to plasticization [b0015], whereas interactions between the matrix and nanoparticle surfaces often modify local chain dynamics, thereby creating an interphase that can percolate through the material and either raise or lower <i>T</i>g\n                         \n                        [b0170 b0175 b0180]. However, the addition of either TCP or CNFs in the present systems results in a very low extent of degradation in <i>T</i>g\n                        , due to the discrete, phase-separated nature of the TCP domains [b0025], as well as suppression of interphase creation in light of the exceptionally high crosslink density of the epoxy network [b0185]. A larger decrease in <i>T</i>g\n                         is observed in the toughened composite with CNFs, which may be due to increased local miscibility of the TCP in the vicinity of CNFs, as suggested by the reduction in TCP domain size compared to the toughened system without CNFs ([f0035] c).']]]
