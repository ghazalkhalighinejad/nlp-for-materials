['In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced composites were fabricated in unidirectional and quasi-isotropic configurations using both neat epoxy and triblock copolymer (TCP)-modified epoxy systems with varying amounts of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Due to the complex interactions between each of the constituents, the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and carbon fibers was enhanced by both the TCP and CNFs, thereby resulting in the observation of epoxy “sheaths” surrounding carbon fibers in fracture surfaces. Despite these improved interactions, enhancements in modulus and strength were only observed in composites containing CNFs due to their robust mechanical properties allowing for improved stress transfer between load-bearing carbon fibers. Tensile modulus and strength in the quasi-isotropic composites were enhanced without reducing strain to failure, and short beam shear strength was increased by ∼15–22% with the addition of CNFs in both composite orientations.', 'The mechanisms responsible for mechanical reinforcement in the systems with nanostructured epoxy as the matrix phase were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Plastic deformation of elastomeric TCP domains yielded increases in <i>G</i>Ic\n                     , whereas the enhanced energy dissipation due to rupture, pullout, unraveling, and splaying of CNFs was partially offset by stress concentrations induced by agglomerated CNFs, thereby resulting in modest toughening by the nanofibers. Despite the observed agglomeration, enhancements in transverse electrical conductivity were seen with the addition of CNFs, indicating their multifunctional behavior.', 'While the mechanical reinforcement reported at 1phr CNFs is comparable to that obtained in other studies for hybrid composites with similar nanoparticle contents, the results presented here correspond to relatively inexpensive nanoparticles in high-performance epoxy systems, which are attractive for advanced structural applications. However, the reduction in mechanical reinforcement at higher CNF contents suggests that enhanced dispersion is required to take full advantage of the CNF potential. Moreover, the change in morphology and size of TCP domains induced by the CNFs provides insight into the importance of understanding the interactions between reinforcing phases in multi-component “hybrid” composite systems, which can have a dramatic influence over the resultant properties.']
