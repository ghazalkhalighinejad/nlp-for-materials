[['Measurements', ['The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments were carried out on a Perkin Elmer DSC7. All samples were subjected to the following protocol: they were heated from room temperature to 290°C at 10°Cmin−1, held there for 10min, and cooled back to room temperature at 10°Cmin−1. The wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments were performed with a copper anode (λ=1.54\n                           \n                              \n                                 A\n                                 ̊\n                              \n                           ). Ni filtered CuKα radiation (in point collimation) was used to perform small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Thin plates were cut by ultramicrotomy from the systems and observed under a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (using a high voltage of 120kV).', 'With regard to the macroscopic characterisation, Dynamic Mechanical Analyses (DMA) were performed on a Rheometrics RMS800. The absolute modulus was determined through mechanical vibration measurements. Compression tests were performed at a strain rate of 0.5%s−1, tensile tests having been carried out at the same rate and at ambient temperature. Capillary rheometry was used to gain insight into the melt viscosity behaviour of the composite systems, at a temperature of 250°C. Volume changes during tensile tests (performed at a nominal strain rate of 0.7%s−1) at room temperature were recorded on a ‘cavitometer’: this special device, developed in our lab, enables to determine the composite volume variations by recording the pressure difference between the sample chamber and a reference one.', 'Prior to any measurement, the massive samples were subjected to a drying procedure, i.e. they were stored under primary vacuum at 95°C during at least 12h.']], ['Composite systems', ['The nanocomposite systems were produced by in situ polymerisation around the inorganic fillers. A silica sol (Klebosol) and caprolactam were mixed into a reactor, the polycondensation of PA6 was then getting started. The final polymer was injection moulded into the required shapes for macroscopic observations. The injected samples were rectangular shape (80×10×4\n                           mm\n                           3), thanks to the ISO 179 standard (type 1). The injection temperature were 250°C for the polymer and 80°C for the mould.', 'Three various types of silica particles were introduced, and three different concentrations were reached. The resulting samples are designed as presented in [TBL1]\n                        .', 'Given the preparation route, the real filler concentration within the prepared composites had to be verified. The measured values are presented in [TBL2]\n                        , along with the systems molar masses.', 'Microscopic control was conducted, in order to get insight into the filler dispersion state within the semi-crystalline matrix. [FIG1] \n                        illustrates the two extreme morphologies the study was carried out on.', 'The smallest particles (12nm in diameter) do not appear as single entities in the polymeric matrix, but tend to form aggregates of structured shapes and random sizes. By contrast, the largest particles (50nm in diameter) are rather well dispersed in the polymer. We notice the presence of smaller particles into the latter composite system: they actually appear to be of diameters of ca. 12 and 25nm.', 'Once again, prior to any measurement, the massive samples were subjected to a drying procedure, i.e. they were stored under primary vacuum at 95°C during at least 12h.']]]
