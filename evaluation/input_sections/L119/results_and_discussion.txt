['[FIG1]\n                      shows the TEM micrograph of a composite. The dispersion of carbon nanotubes in the polymer matrix is good, with no large agglomerates present in the specimen. Moreover, no apparent damage or breakage of the nanotubes is observed. Therefore, melt blending at 200°C does not damage the nanotubes, demonstrating that polymer/carbon nanotube composites can be fabricated by melt blending. Unlike composites prepared by in situ polymerization or solution mixing which may be contaminated by residual monomer or solvent, composites prepared by melt blending are essentially free of contaminants.', '[FIG2]\n                      shows the TGA curves of PMMA and various composites. Pure PMMA starts to degrade in a nitrogen atmosphere at about 320°C and is completely degraded at about 430°C. The incorporation of MWNTs into PMMA offers a stabilizing effect since the onset of degradation occurs at a higher temperature. The composite containing 26 wt.% MWNTs starts to degrade at 350°C which is 30°C higher than for PMMA. The weights of the composites remain fairly constant at the temperature beyond 430°C, indicating that the PMMA matrix has degraded completely and the residue contains only the nanotubes. Troitskii et al. [BIB29] studied the thermal degradation of PMMA in the presence of C60 by isothermal thermogravimetry. C60 retards the thermal degradation of PMMA and the retardation effect was attributed to interactions between C60 and macroradicals generated during the degradation process.', 'The mechanical behaviors of polymers and polymer composites are commonly studied by DMA, a technique in which the storage modulus (<i>E</i>\n                     ′) and loss modulus (<i>E</i>″) of the sample, under oscillating load, are monitored against time, temperature or frequency of oscillation [BIB30]. The ratio <i>E</i>″/<i>E</i>\n                     ′ is the loss tangent (tan<i>δ</i>). The moduli will change with temperature as the molecular motions within the polymer change. The storage modulus of a polymer decreases rapidly whereas the loss modulus and tan<i>δ</i> go through a maximum when the polymer is heated through the glass transition region. The maximum of the tan<i>δ</i> is commonly taken as the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     g).', '[FIG3]\n                      shows the storage moduli of PMMA and various composites. The storage modulus of PMMA is increased by the stiffening effect of the nanotubes, which is particularly significant at higher temperatures. For example, the modulus is increased by a factor of 1.6–2.0 at 40°C whereas it shows a 5–27-fold increase at 120°C. In addition, the presence of carbon nanotubes also enables the matrix to sustain a high modulus value to higher temperature. The ratio of the modulus at 120°C to that at 40°C is only 0.03 for PMMA, but 0.50 for the composite containing 26 wt.% nanotube ([FIG4]\n                     ).', 'Compared to the carbon nanotube/PVA composites [BIB13], the stiffening effect is more significant for PMMA. The storage moduli of a PVA composite containing 30 wt.% of nanotubes are about 1.4 and 6.0 times of those of PVA at 40°C and 120°C, respectively. PMMA is an amorphous polymer whereas PVA is a semicrystalline polymer. The crystallites in PVA already impart a high modulus and hence the nanotubes do not produce a dramatic increase in the stiffness of the PVA matrix. In fact, Shaffer and Windle [BIB13] did predict that a larger improvement in the modulus would be observed if an amorphous polymer matrix was used in place of PVA.', '[FIG5]\n                      shows the tan<i>δ</i> peaks of the composites. The peak moves to a slightly higher temperature with increasing nanotube content, showing that the <i>T</i>\n                     g of the composite is raised by the addition of nanotubes. In other words, nanotubes hinder the segmental motion of the PMMA chains. The tan<i>δ</i> peak broadens slightly upon the incorporation of nanotubes. However, the broadening is not as significant as that observed for the PVA composites [BIB13]. The different nature of the two polymers, amorphous versus semicrystalline, may play a major role in determining the extent of tan<i>δ</i> broadening.', 'In conclusion, melt blending offers a simple and effective means to fabricate carbon nanotube/PMMA composites. The nanotubes show no apparent damage and are well dispersed in the polymer matrix. The nanotubes delay the onset of thermal degradation of PMMA. The storage modulus of the polymer is significantly increased particularly at high temperatures. The tan<i>δ</i> peak of the composite shows some broadening and moves to a slightly higher temperature.']
