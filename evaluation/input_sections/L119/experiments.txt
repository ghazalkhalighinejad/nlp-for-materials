['MWNTs were synthesized by the arc-discharge method and used without further purification. PMMA (weight-average molecular weight=49000, polydispersity=1.58) was purchased from BDH Chemicals.', 'PMMA (0.4 g) and various amounts of MWNTs were mixed in a Laboratory Mixing Molder (ATLAS, USA) at 200°C for 20 min at a speed of 120 rpm. The mixed samples were then compressed under a pressure of about 8–9 MPa at 210°C for 5 min using a hydraulic press to give grayish and transparent films. The films were fixed in an epoxy matrix and then cut using an ultrathintome. The ultrathin films were used for the TEM observation (JEOL CX100, 100 kV).', 'TGA measurements were performed using a TA Instruments SDT 2960 Simultaneous DTA-TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere from room temperature to 700°C. DMA measurements were performed using a TA Instruments DMA 2980 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. The samples were heated under a nitrogen atmosphere from room temperature to 150°C at a heating rate of 3°C/min and a frequency of 1 Hz.']
