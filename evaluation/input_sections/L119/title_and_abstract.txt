Dynamic mechanical behavior of melt-processed multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly(methyl methacrylate) composites
Multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly(methyl methacrylate) composites have been fabricated by melt blending. The nanotubes are well dispersed in the polymer matrix with no apparent damage or breakage. The dynamic mechanical behavior of the composites has been studied. The storage modulus of the polymer is significantly increased by the incorporation of nanotubes particularly at high temperatures.
