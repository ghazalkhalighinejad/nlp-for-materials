['Novel thermoplastic 0-3 type BST-COC composites were studied using common-size (Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3) and nanosize (Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3) BST powders and a thermoplastic COC polymer (TOPASÂ® 8007S-04). The composites were prepared with different volume fractions of BST powders. The microstructures of the composites showed homogeneous distribution of the BST fillers in the COC polymer matrix in all the samples. The relative permittivity and loss tangent were investigated as a function of BST loading at 1GHz and as a function of temperature at 0.1MHz. The results showed that the relative permittivity and loss tangent of the composites gradually increased as the volume fraction of BST was increased. The BSTn-COC composite with nanopowder showed higher relative permittivity and loss at BST loading over 10vol.% compared with the composites with common-size BST powder. Using a 25% volume fraction of BST, a relative permittivity of 7.3 and a loss tangent of 0.0023 were obtained for the BSTn-COC nanocomposite at 1GHz, and 6.0 and 0.0009, respectively, for the common BSTc-COC composite. The modified equation of the Lichtenecker logarithmic law showed good correspondence for composites made from common-size BST powder, but discrepancies were observed in composites with nano-BST powder at >10vol.% loading.']
