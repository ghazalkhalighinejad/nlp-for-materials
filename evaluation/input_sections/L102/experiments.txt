['BST-COC composites were manufactured from commercial BST powders and a granular COC polymer in a HAAKE Rheocord mixer system (CG-5902 Torque Rheometer, Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The COC was Topas® 8007S-04 (Ticona GmbH, Germany) with a density of 1.02g/cm3 and a melting temperature of 190–250°C. The common-size Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3 powder (Filtronic Comtek Ltd., UK) was calcined at 1100°C for 4h with a fired density of 5.5g/cm3 for a bulk sample. The nanosize Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 powder (Sigma–Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany) had a fired density of 4.9g/cm3. First the COC polymer was weighed and put into the chamber of the Torque Rheometer at a 230°C temperature, followed by slow addition of the BST powder. After mixing at a speed of 32–64rpm for 10–20min, the BST-COC composite was taken from the chamber and hot-pressed at a 200°C temperature to form samples for measurements.', 'The volume fraction indicating the final loading level of the ceramic was calculated using the weight and density of pure BST and COC. Microstructure analyses were done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Jeol JSM-6400, Jeol Ltd., Japan) and X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD, Siemens D5000, Siemens AG, Germany), utilizing the JCPDS data file (International Center for Diffraction Data 1992, USA). The specific surface area of the BST powders was measured with a COULTER OMNISORP 360CX (Coulter Electronics Ltd., UK).', 'Composite samples with a length and width of 20–30mm and a thickness of 1.5–2mm were made by hot-pressing for electrical measurements. The samples were polished to ensure good surface quality and parallel surfaces. Relative permittivity and the loss tangent at a frequency of 1GHz were measured at room temperature with an Agilent E4991A RF Impedance/Material Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). Electrodes were manufactured by sputtering a copper layer on both surfaces. Wires were soldered on the copper electrodes and the dielectric properties were measured as a function of temperature at 0.1MHz using a HP 4284A precision LCR meter (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) and a LINKAM temperature control system (a TMS94 temperature controller and an LNP94 automated liquid nitrogen cooling pump, Linkam Scientific instruments Ltd., UK).']
