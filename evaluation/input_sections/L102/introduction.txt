['Materials used in microelectronic packaging have to simultaneously fulfill diverse requirements, like low dielectric loss, moderate relative permittivity and moisture absorption resistance, as well as a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high dimensional stability and mechanical stiffness.[bib1]1\n                      Ceramic–polymer composites, especially type 0-3, form a potential material group suitable for producing demanding and functional packages that combine the electrical properties of ceramic and the mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and processing possibilities of polymers. The feasibility of these composites for use in piezoelectric and pyroelectric applications, flexible sensors, transducers, thick film dielectrics, embedded capacitors, tunable antennas and other multilayer RF devices has been studied.[bib2 bib3 bib4]2–4\n                      The research has mainly concentrated on epoxy-ceramic composites,[bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]5–8\n                      but also other polymers, such as PVDF,[bib9]9\n                      P(VDF–TrFE),[bib10]10\n                      silicon-rubber,[bib11]11\n                      polyimide,[bib12]12\n                      polyvinylchloride (PVC),[bib13]13\n                      cyanoethylated cellulose polymer (CR-S),[bib14]14\n                      polystyrene,[bib15]15\n                      and polyurethane,[bib16]16\n                      have been used. However, only a few composites that use thermoplastic polymers have been reported.[bib17 bib18]17,18\n                      These polymers have excellent chemical stability and good mechanical processing possibilties, as they can be net-shaped at elevated temperatures to make, e.g. sheets or a 3D structure, using injection molding, lamination or extrusion. Thus, thermoplastic polymers are attractive candidates for 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composites.', "The main goal of this research was to introduce a novel 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composite made of thermoplastic polymer (cyclic olefin copolymer, COC) with different loadings of ferroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST). Recently it has also been reported that the nanosize ceramic powders of 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composites could enhance the composite's loading and microstructure.[bib19 bib20]19,20\n                      Thus, an additional objective of the research was to examine how the dielectric properties differ when the particle size of the ceramic filler is decreased from micro to nano-scale. The loading effect of two different BST materials (Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3 with micrometer-scale particles and Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 with nanometer-scale particles) on the microstructure and dielectric properties of the composite was analyzed and discussed."]
