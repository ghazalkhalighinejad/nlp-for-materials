['We have shown the feasibility of producing high dielectric permittivity nanoparticles (TiO2) uniformly dispersed within polymer matrices. All nanoparticles were confined within the crosslinked sulfonated styrene blocks and no effect was observed on the phase separation behavior of the S-SEBS block copolymer. Dielectric experiments showed that higher permittivity composites can thus be obtained with a significant decrease in loss tan\n                     <i>Î´</i> (<0.01) when crosslinked with vinyltrimethoxysilane.']
