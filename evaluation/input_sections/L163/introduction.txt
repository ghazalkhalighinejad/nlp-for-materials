['High dielectric permittivity (<i>ɛ</i>) polymer-based shape conforming composites have potential for applications in microwave communication devices [bib1], artificial muscles [bib2], and embedded capacitors for microelectromechanical systems [bib3 bib4]. Weight, shape-flexibility, cost effectiveness and good processability of the material are also the key factors for these applications, which is the main reason why many research efforts utilize polymeric composites. The most common process for enhancing the dielectric permittivity of a polymer is to disperse a high dielectric permittivity insulating ceramic powder such as barium titanate (BaTiO3) [bib3 bib5 bib6] and lead titanate (PbTiO3) [bib7] into the polymers to form composites. In order to obtain a high value of dielectric permittivity, large amount of fillers has to be loaded, resulting in loss of flexibility and inhomogeneous composites. Another approach to obtain high dielectric permittivity composites is to utilize conductive fillers (near their percolation threshold) to produce the composites. By dispersing conductive particles, e.g., carbon nanofibers [bib5 bib6], silver particles [bib4] and copper phthalocyanine oligomers [bib2 bib8] into a polymer matrix, it has been demonstrated that the dielectric permittivity of the polymer significantly increases. The increased dielectric permittivity observed in such composites arises from conducting particles isolated by very thin dielectric layers to form micro-capacitors. However, the dielectric loss is very high and difficult to control, because the particles can easily form a conductive path in the composite as the filler concentration nears the percolation threshold.', 'The challenge to produce dielectric nanocomposites relies on the ability to manipulate the fraction, characteristic length, and arrangement of dielectric components inside the engineered composite. No systematic study to date has been published on the influence of effective volume fraction, characteristic length, and arrangement of dielectric components on the effective permittivity (<i>ɛ</i>) of the composites due to the intrinsic incompatibility between inorganic particles and organic matrices. Most published experiments have utilized the conventional method of blending dielectric particles into polymers, which has no real control on particle size and distribution within the polymer matrix [bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]. However, it has been shown that the characteristic length (surface-to-volume ratio) of particles and their distribution and effective volume within the composites will significantly affect their dielectric properties [bib9 bib10]. For polymeric composites made of copper phthalocyanine, as an example, smaller particles display higher permittivity and lower dielectric loss compared to those made of larger particles [bib8].', 'The most promising way to elucidate the effect of all these factors on the dielectric properties of the composites is to make a nanocomposite, particularly with block copolymers which are well-known for their ability to template nanoparticles with narrow size distribution and uniform confinement throughout their periodic microdomains [bib11 bib12 bib13]. The use of block copolymers is shown to afford opportunities for controlling the spatial distribution and orientation of the nanocomponents. This allows much more sophisticated tailoring of the overall properties of the composite materials. The dielectric loss of a material, which limits frequency selectivity, is heavily influenced by factors such as ionic conduction and structural heterogeneities (microstructure defects or porosity), which will generate flow of charges and results in thermal dissipation of energy [bib14]. Block copolymer nanocomposites could significantly reduce such factors causing dielectric loss by providing insulation layers and highly periodic templated nanoparticles.', 'We report a novel method of producing high dielectric permittivity polymer-based composites by utilizing a block copolymer. The nature of the self-assembled nanoscale morphology of the block copolymer enables the formation of stable particles uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix. Sulfonated [styrene-<i>b</i>-(ethylene-<i>ran</i>-butylene)-<i>b</i>-styrene] (S-SEBS) block copolymers containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3H) were selected to investigate their ability to template nanoparticles within their self-assembled microstructures. In order to obtain high dielectric permittivity particles, organic complexes of titanium were selected to form titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles which preferentially associate with sulfonic acid groups of one of the blocks of the copolymer. Upon solvent evaporation and film casting, nanoparticles are formed via a hydrolysis reaction uniformly distributed within the polymer matrix, which acts as a template to enhance the ordering of the high dielectric permittivity nanoparticles. The crosslinker (vinyltrimethoxysilane) was also incorporated into S-SEBS block copolymers to study its effect on dielectric and mechanic properties of the composites. The composites were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and dielectric analysis (DEA).']
