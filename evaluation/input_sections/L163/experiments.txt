[['Materials', ['Titanium acetylacetonate (TYZOR AA105) was supplied by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Sulfonated [styrene-<i>b</i>-(ethylene-<i>ran</i>-butylene)-<i>b</i>-styrene] (S-SEBS) block copolymer solution and vinyltrimethoxysilane were purchased from Aldrich. The molecular weight of the S-SEBS block copolymer was 80,000g/mol consisting 29wt% styrene blocks and 59.7mol% of styrene blocks sulfonated. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.']], ['S-SEBS templated titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles', ['Titanium acetylacetonate was selected as the precursor to form the TiO2 nanoparticles. The S-SEBS solutions were mixed with different concentrations of precursors, where the molar ratio between SO3H groups of S-SEBS and Ti was 100:2, 4, 16, and 32. The solution was vigorously stirred for\xa030min. The Ti organometallic complexes preferentially attached to the sulfonated styrene blocks. A solid film was formed by static casting over a period of one week. The Ti organometallic complexes attached to the SO3H groups were gradually hydrolyzed and formed titanium oxide nanoparticles within the sulfonated styrene blocks.']], ['S-SEBS templated titanium dioxide (TiO2) composites with crosslinker', ['The procedure was the same as for synthesis of S-SEBS templated TiO2, except that both vinyltrimethoxysilane crosslinker and TiO2 precursors were simultaneously added to S-SEBS polymer solutions. The molar ratio of crosslinker to SO3H groups within the copolymer was kept at 2.5 while the molar percentage of Ti/SO3H varied from 2 to 32. The solution was vigorously stirred for 30min, then poured into a Teflon boat. A solid film was formed by static casting over a period of one week. The resulting films were placed in an oven for heat-treatment at 150°C for 24h and exposed to UV light (260–320nm) for 20min at 150°C.']], ['Characterization', ['X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS 165, Kratos) was used to investigate the oxidation state of titanium. The charge-shifted spectra were corrected assuming that the adventitious <i>C</i>1<i>s</i> peak detected was at 284.600eV. Dielectric measurements for the resulting S-SEBS nanocomposites were performed using a dielectric analyzer (DEA 2970, TA Instruments). The samples were sandwiched between the ceramic parallel plate sensors, and subjected to a force of 200N. The DEA cell was purged with dry nitrogen at a flow rate of 500mL/min for 30min to ensure the absence of moisture during measurements. The experiments were performed at frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 22, 46, 100, 215, 464, 1000, 2150, 4640, 10,000Hz at 35°C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HITACHI H-600) operated at 100keV was used to observe the morphology of the composites. The samples for TEM were prepared by solvent casting directly onto a copper grid and were visualized without any staining to enhance TEM contrast. Tensile strength and ultimate elongation, as well as storage and loss modulus transitions were studied with a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA Q800, TA Instruments). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-50, SHIMADZU) was used to investigate the thermal stability of the composite. Samples were heated at 10°C/min under ambient conditions.']]]
