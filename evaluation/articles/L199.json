{"title": "Measurement of the critical aspect ratio and interfacial shear strength in MWNT/polymer composites", "abstract": "This paper presents a bulk composite method for determining the critical aspect ratio and relative interfacial shear stress (ISS) for multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites. Through a modified pullout test and fragmentation test, it was found that the critical aspect ratio was 300 and decreased by a factor of 3 due to surface modification, and that MWNTs at an angle of greater than 60\u00b0 to the loading direction failed in bending instead of pulling out of the matrix. Finite element analysis was used to determine the critical bending shear strength and MWNT modulus. The obtained bending shear strength was used in a mechanics model developed to provide bounds for the ISS in the experimental composite system. The calculated ISS for as-received nanotube falls between 4.8 and 13.7MPa, and for surface treated nanotube falls in the range of 11.1 and 38.3MPa. These values are consistent with the ISS reported for carbon fiber/polymer composites and also show that the ISS almost triples due to chemical modification of the MWNT surface.", "body": [["Introduction", ["In order to optimize the properties of carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites, key micromechanical parameters, such as the nanotube/polymer interfacial shear stress (ISS) and load transfer length (or load transfer aspect ratio), must be quantified. Because these parameters are not well known in nanotube composites, it is difficult to compare measured mechanical properties to predicted values [bib1 bib2] particularly for short fiber composite models. In micron scale composites where the ISS and load transfer length can be directly measured, these quantities can be more reliably predicted [bib3 bib4]. For example, the lower than expected Young\u2019s modulus observed in MWNT/polymer composites is often attributed to poor dispersion [bib5 bib6 bib7] or nanotube waviness [bib8]. In addition, however, MWNTs with an aspect ratio near or below the aspect ratio required for complete load transfer can also be the cause of low Young\u2019s modulus. [fig1]\n                      shows a typical result from the Kelly\u2013Tyson model in which load is transferred from the lower modulus matrix to the higher modulus fiber via a constant interfacial shear stress [bib9], perhaps due to plastic deformation at the interface or do to frictional load transfer. We use a simplified model such as Kelly\u2013Tyson because the shape of the stress transfer function is unknown in these systems, and for the purposes of this paper, assuming a constant ISS is useful. If the strain is increased in the composite until the resulting fiber stress is larger than the failure stress, the fiber fractures ([fig1]a). If the aspect ratio (AR) of the fibers is too low (either as-grown or due to fracture during processing), then the equistrain condition is not met, and the fibers do not carry the maximum load ([fig1]c). Therefore, if the AR of the MWNT is too low, the Young\u2019s modulus of the composite is reduced.", "The load transfer aspect ratio changes as a function of applied strain ([fig1]a). In this paper, we determine the critical aspect ratio (ARc), which is defined as in [fig1]b and is a function both of the strength of the fiber and the fiber/matrix ISS. For purposes of discussion, if a constant ISS is assumed, then the ARc can be calculated as [bib10]\n                     \n                        \n                           (1)\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   L\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                   c\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                          \n                                             r\n                                          \n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \u03c3\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          f\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \u03c4\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          ave\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     where <i>\u03c4</i>ave\n                      is the average ISS, <i>\u03c3</i>f\n                      is the strength of the fiber, (<i>L</i>c\n                     /<i>r</i>, critical fiber length/radius) is the ARc. If the ARc is measured, an average ISS can be calculated.", "In order to measure ISS, and ARc, several micromechanical tests have been developed. In the fiber fragmentation test, a fiber of length, <i>L</i>, is placed in a composite and as the composite is loaded, the load in the fiber exceeds the fracture strength and fails. The aspect ratio at which the fiber is just long enough to reach an equistrain condition ([fig1]b), and thus reach the critical fiber failure stress, is the ARc. The ISS can then be calculated from the ARc with varying levels of complexity [bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. In addition, knowing the ARc is important for: (1) understanding fracture behavior because longer fibers can lead to improved damage resistance through crack bridging and (2) predicting the modulus of short fiber (or nanotube) composites [bib4 bib16 bib17].", "A second test, the pullout test, uses the same principle as the fiber fragmentation test, but a fiber is embedded in a matrix, and the force to pullout the fiber is measured. The pullout force, <i>F</i>pullout\n                     , as a function of embedded length can be used to calculate the ISS as [bib9]\n                     \n                        \n                           (2)\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \u03c4\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    ave\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    pullout\n                                 \n                              \n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          F\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          pullout\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    2\n                                    \u03c0\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          rL\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          pullout", "In addition, if the embedded aspect ratio is longer than the ARc, the fiber will break, and the pull-out aspect ratio will be the ARc.", "Pioneering experiments by Wagner\u2019s group [bib18 bib19 bib20] used nanoscale versions of these traditional micromechanical tests to measure the ISS in nanotube composites. Their results show direct evidence of increases in ISS due to surface modification of MWNT. Both pullout energies and interfacial shear strengths were measured from the pullout test.", "The challenge in using the current nanoscale methods is that it is difficult to obtain the statistics necessary to fully characterize the interfacial behavior due to the complexity of the tests. The ARc is actually a distribution of values, and thus statistics are required. In this paper, using a bulk composite approach, the ARc and relative values of the ISS were measured as a function of interface modification. Additionally, using an analytical approach, the bounds for the ISS were calculated."]], ["Experimental", ["Bisphenol A Polycarbonate (PC, Lexan 124, GE Plastics) was used as the polymer matrix. MWNTs were grown using a thermal chemical vapor deposition of xylene\u2013ferrocene feedstock at 727\u00b0C in a quartz tube furnace [bib21 bib22]. Decomposition and deposition of the xylene\u2013 ferrocene vapor onto the substrate was allowed to proceed for the requisite time for a MWNT growth length of 1mm. The as-received multiwall nanotubes (ARNTs) were grown with a mean diameter of 31nm (standard deviation of 25.4nm). [fig2]\n                      shows a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) image of the untreated multiwall nanotubes. Using a method published earlier [bib23] the untreated nanotubes were chemically modified to create an epoxide terminated functionalized group (EPNT). The functionalized MWNTs react with the polycarbonate through a thermal trans-esterification reaction to create a covalent linkage between the MWNT and the matrix [bib24 bib25].", "MWNT filled polycarbonate composites were prepared using a precipitation method. Bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC) was dried for 2h under vacuum at 125\u00b0C to remove any residual moisture and then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with sonication. The MWNTs were sonicated for 2min using a wand sonicator and the MWNT dispersion and PC solution were mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 3min. The mixture was poured drop-wise into methanol, precipitating the composite. The precipitated composite material was filtered under vacuum and dried under vacuum at 60\u00b0C for 15h. The samples were crushed using a mortar and pestle and dried under vacuum for an additional 12h. To remove any potential induced polymer crystallinity, the composite was then heated to 190\u00b0C for 1h. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to ensure that no crystallinity remained. Five weight percent (3.5vol.%) MWNT/polycarbonate composites (of both as-received and surface-modified states) were prepared. All samples for testing were made by compression molding 0.6g of material per sample in a Carver press at a temperature of 250\u00b0C and pressure of 1 ton for 5min.", "The dog bone-shaped samples were failed in tension in liquid nitrogen to reduce plastic deformation, using ASTM D 638-02 with an Instron 3042 testing machine at a strain rate of 4%/min. The fractured edge of each sample was carefully embedded into an epoxy mixture and cured for 24h at 60\u00b0C in a vacuum oven ([fig3]\n                     ). The embedded specimens were ultramicrotomed perpendicular to the fractured edge, as illustrated in [fig3]a, to a thickness approximating 50nm using an RMC Product Ultra Microtome MTXL machine by Boeckler.", "A TEM (Phillips CM12) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, JEOL 6335) were employed to characterize the morphology and dispersion of the MWNT within each sample. [fig3]b shows a schematic description of the key parameters investigated within this study: pullout length, pullout diameter and pullout angle. It should also be noted in [fig3]b that the measured pullout angle is the difference between the angle of the MWNT to the fracture edge and the loading direction. [fig3]c shows an FESEM image of the fracture surface with the MWNTs protruding from the surface and [fig3]d shows a typical TEM image taken as shown schematically in [fig3]a and b. ImageJ imaging software was used to measure the pull-out aspect ratio and angle of nanotubes along the fracture edge for the TEM images. In addition, the fragmentation aspect ratio of the MWNT in the grip section and 1mm from the fracture surface were determined by dissolving the matrix in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and placing a sample of each region on a TEM grid. Over 100 nanotubes were measured to obtain a statistically sound average aspect ratio. Since the grip region would not experience any deformation during loading, the distribution of aspect ratios in the grip region was used as a post-processing baseline."]], ["Experimental results", [["Dispersion", ["[fig4]\n                        a and b show low magnification FESEM images of the fracture edge of the ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC composites, respectively at 5wt.%. These are representative images and no agglomerates were seen across the fracture surface, indicating that the MWNT were well dispersed."]], ["MWNT fracture", ["[fig5]\n                        a shows a comparison of aspect ratios of the nanotubes within the grip section in the ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC composites dissolved in THF. The MWNTs were grown to an initial aspect ratio of approximately 32000. However, in the grip section the nanotubes have an average aspect ratio of 1926.6 and 708 for ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC samples, respectively. These values indicate a decrease in aspect ratio by over an order of magnitude during processing, most likely from the wand sonication. The treated tubes received additional sonication during surface treatment and thus showed a larger reduction in aspect ratio. [fig5] also shows, however, that in the fracture region there is a further significant decrease in the aspect ratio range with average aspect ratios of 349.3 and 86.4 for ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC, respectively. These decreases indicate fracture of the nanotubes during composite loading.", "Given that the nanotube pullout lengths are due to failure during loading and are not different due to differences in the initial lengths, the pull-out aspect ratio and pullout angle were measured from TEM slices as indicated in [fig3]. The pullout angle is defined as the angle with respect to the loading direction ([fig3]). The results are shown in [fig6]\n                        . Three aspects of [fig6] are to be noted. First, the treated MWNT have much shorter pull-out aspect ratio than the as-received nanotubes. Second, above approximately 60\u00b0, most of the nanotubes failed at the fracture surface, and did not pullout. This is seen by the lack of data above about 60\u00b0. It is likely that the failure mode was due to the bending load on the MWNT, as discussed further below. Third, the pull-out aspect ratio is not a function of angle. Thus, at all angles, the fibers must have failed to an aspect ratio that is at or below the ARc.", "Due to the 50nm thicknesses of the TEM slices, some of the tubes are artificially shortened, leading to very low apparent aspect ratios with averages of 12.6 and 4.61 for the ARNT and EPNT respectively. However, the data show that although pullout occurred at angles below 60\u00b0, the pullout length was not a function of pullout angle. This implies that instead of relying on the TEM data, which may have artifacts, that we can use FESEM images to quantify the full pull-out aspect ratios ([fig3]c). A quantitative comparison between [fig6 fig7]\n                         shows that the distribution of aspect ratios between the ARNT and EPNT are similar for the two techniques even though the absolute values are different: treated tubes have a narrower distribution and a shorter average pull-out aspect ratio while untreated tubes have a broader distribution and a larger average pull-out aspect ratio.", "Finally, because the aspect ratio was not a function of angle, the critical fragmentation aspect ratio was obtained by dissolving the matrix away near the fracture surface. Thus, the ARc measured via pullout (both from TEM and FESEM), and via essentially a fragmentation test (using the data from [fig4]b) were recorded. While the latter numbers will be impacted by those nanotubes that failed in bending at angles greater than 60\u00b0, this is a small population of the fibers ([fig6]).", "To use the ARc to calculate a simple average ISS using Eq. [fd1], the nanotube strength must be known. In addition, it must be assumed that the strength of the MWNT was not altered due to surface modification. Fortunately, Barber performed strength calculations using an AFM pullout test on MWNT produced using a CVD growth method and the same trans-esterification surface modification procedure as used in this study [bib27 bib28]. It was found that the pullout force at which the MWNT started to fail was the same for the treated and surface modified MWNT, and if there was a difference, the strength of the surface treated MWNT was higher than that of the untreated tubes. Using the force at failure from Barber\u2019s paper [bib20] for very similar MWNT, a nominal MWNT strength of 2.5\u00b11.5GPa was determined. Even if the actual nanotube strength for the MWNT in this study differs, this method still provides a measure of the ratio of the ISS of the treated MWNT to the as-received MWNT.", "[tbl1]\n                         compares ARc and the calculated average ISS (Eq. [fd1]) of ARNT and EPNT composites measured after dissolution of the matrix (essentially traditional fragmentation test), from microtomed slices of the fracture edge using TEM, and from FESEM of the fracture edge. Please note the aspect ratios in [tbl1] from the experimental measurements are relative measures only, except for the first method. Specifically, the aspect ratios using the fragmentation (dissolution) technique are actual measurements of the fragmentation lengths. In the TEM (slice) technique, the fragmentation lengths are approximated by adding the measured nanotube embedded length and pulled out length, and are additionally shortened by the process of obtaining the TEM slices because nanotubes not in the plane of the slice, will be prematurely cut. Thus, while this technique can provide a relative ratio of ISS, these are not absolute values. In the FESEM technique, fragmentation lengths are approximated by doubling the measured pulled out length. This approximation is necessary because the embedded length is not observed. The approximation, although coarse, is based on the fact that the pulled out part of a fiber is typically shorter than its embedded part. The dissolution technique, however, provides the most robust measure of fragmentation length because it is measured directly. Note that in [tbl1] the average ratio of the ISS for untreated and surface modified MWNT among all three techniques is around 1:3. This result is in strong agreement with studies where chemical surface modification has been shown to improve the interfacial bonding between matrix and nanotubes and hence the ISS of nanotube-filled composites [bib1 bib20 bib25 bib26 bib32]. It also indicates that while the absolute values of the pullout length from each of the techniques varies, to find relative changes due to surface modification, they are all useful."]]]], ["Analysis and discussion", ["To further quantify the ISS values, numerical simulations and an analytical approach were employed. The approach utilizes the experimental observations that for nanotubes inclined at greater than 60\u00b0, nanotube fracture occurred rather than pullout ([fig6]). Based on this information, we develop approximate expressions to provide bounds for the ISS of the nanotube\u2013polymer interface in the composite.", "Before developing the analysis, it is important to identify the critical failure stresses for the nanotubes. The average value of Young\u2019s modulus for the MWNTs used in the experiments was 500GPa, resulting in a nominal <i>E</i>NT\n                     \n                     =444GPa (defining nominal values to use the entire MWNT cross-section as if it were solid). For a nominal tensile strength of MWNT, we adopt the value of fracture force of 5\u00b13\u03bcN [bib20], divided it by MWNT cross-sectional area to obtain a nominal <i>\u03c3</i>NT\n                        \n                     =2.5\u00b11.5GPa [bib19], which is consistent with the number reported by other researches [bib30]. Due to the failure of nanotubes at large inclined angles, it is essential also to have the bending shear behavior of the nanotubes, which has not yet been determined experimentally. Therefore, the shear modulus of MWNTs were estimated by finite element simulations of the nanotube cage structure, performed using ABAQUS [bib31], In this approach, the carbon\u2013carbon (C\u2013C) bonds in the nanotubes are modeled using beam elements with <i>E</i>\n                     =5.49TPa, and the shear modulus, <i>G</i>\n                     =0.871TPa, and the radius of cross-section for these bonds is taken as 0.735\u00c5 [bib32 bib33] In our current simulation, the inter wall sliding inside the MWNT is ignored, as for nanotubes embedded completely inside a stiff polymer matrix, the inter wall sliding, if any, is unlikely to affect its effective shear modulus. Small strain, three point bending tests were performed in ABAQUS on the MWNT structures, illustrated in [fig8]\n                     a by a SWNT to show this approach schematically and clearly, to obtain their shear modulus, <i>G</i>NT\n                     , based on the beam deflection formulation [bib34]\n                     \n                        \n                           (3)\n                           \n                              \u03b4\n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          FL\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          3\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    192\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          E\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          NT\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    I\n                                 \n                              \n                              +\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          f\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          s\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    FL\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    4\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          G\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          NT\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    A\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     where the first term on the right hand side is due to bending, and the second term is due to shear deformation. Please note that all the numbers used for the analysis are obtained for the MWNT sample used in our experiments. For example, the moment of inertia, I, does consider layers of the MWNT. By using the deflection formulation (Eq. [fd3]), we implicitly treated the nanotube as an isotropic beam, therefore there is only one bending shear modulus involved. The shear modulus, <i>G</i>NT\n                     , obtained here is an effective modulus, which, however, is enough for the purpose of our current model.", "As a result, the nominal <i>G</i>NT\n                      was calculated to be 115GPa. We assume that the ratio of shear to Young\u2019s moduli is approximately the same as the ratio of the corresponding strengths because ideally a material\u2019s theoretical strength is related to its modulus. Based on this assumption, we obtain the nominal bending shear strength of the nanotube <i>\u03c4</i>NT\n                      as approximately 0.64\u00b10.38GPa.", "[fig8]b shows the schematics of the nanotube bridging analysis. It is assumed that the applied pullout force from the matrix is equally distributed onto each crack-bridging nanotube. For the purposes of analysis, solid cross-sections are used, consistent with the nominal <i>\u03c3</i>NT\n                      value taken based on Barber\u2019s paper [bib20]. The loading on the nanotubes inclined more than 60\u00b0, most of which failed at the fracture surface rather than pulling out, was first examined. Due to the large inclined angle, it was assumed that these broken nanotubes fail due to bending shear. Thus the critical pullout force, <i>F</i>crit\n                      on a nanotube such that the tube fails under bending shear can be defined as,\n                        \n                           (4)\n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          F\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          crit\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    sin\n                                    \u03b8\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    A\n                                 \n                              \n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \u03c4\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    NT\n                                 \n                              \n                              \n                              for\n                              \n                              \u03b8\n                              \u2a7e\n                              60\n                              \u00b0\n                           \n                        \n                     where <i>\u03b8</i> is the inclined angle, and <i>A</i>\n                     =\n                     <i>\u03c0r</i>\n                     2 is nanotube cross-sectional area, and <i>r</i> is nanotube outer radius.

[tbl2] shows that the ISS from the fragmentation equation approach agree quite well with the obtained ISS bounds through pullout analysis. Further, the magnitudes for ISS are physically reasonable values for the shear stress of these MWNT/polymer composites because the yield strength of the polycarbonate matrix (approximately 60MPa) has not been surpassed. These results indicated that the shear strength ratio of untreated to treated samples is approximately 1:3. This suggests that the chemical modification of the nanotube surfaces increases the ISS which is supported by several other studies [bib20 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29].", "The implications of this work, however, are farther reaching. The ARc was about 300 for the as-received nanotubes. For 30nm diameter nanotubes, this means that the critical length is on the order of 10\u03bcm. To achieve the high modulus expected for MWNT/polymer composites, therefore, the nanotubes need to maintain a length of perhaps 100\u03bcm to be effective. Therefore, the reduced modulus compared to the expected values reported in the literature could be due to the use of nanotubes that are not long enough to reach the equistrain condition."]], ["Conclusions", ["Using an experimental technique to measure the interfacial shear strength and critical aspect ratio in MWNT/polymer composites, it was found that:\n                        \n                           1.\n                           For matrices that can be dissolved after processing of the composites, and MWNT initially long enough that they can fail during loading, a fragmentation based test can be used to determine at least the relative ISS due to surface modification.\n                        \n                        \n                           2.\n                           For nanotubes that are well dispersed in the polycarbonate, the study found at a critical angle of 60\u00b0, there was a change in failure mechanism from pullout to fracture of the nanotubes due to bending shear stress.\n                        \n                        \n                           3.\n                           Using an analytical method, bounds for the interfacial stress were determined.
