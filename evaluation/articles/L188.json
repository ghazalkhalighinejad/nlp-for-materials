The rate of weight loss at 220\u00b0C for 2h was also markedly reduced in the presence of these modified silicas. The results might be attributed to \u201ctrapping effect\u201d.

The mechanical and thermal properties of inorganic/organic nanocomposites are expected to be considerably improved when the largest possible inorganic surface area is presented to the matrix. To achieve this improvement, the fillers must be fully dispersed throughout, and connected to the matrix using an appropriately modified intermediary to increase the hydrophobicity of the inorganic composites [BIB8]. Silica particles, however, are difficult to disperse in organic solvent without surfactant because they tend to form large aggregations.", "This work concerns the problem of silica particle dispersion and demonstrates a route to prevent the aggregation of silica by modifying silica surface. These modified silica particles disperse well among various monomers to form inorganic/polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, organically modified silica makes inorganic components more hydrophobic, causing them to disperse effectively throughout organic solvent or polymer matrices. Therefore, inorganic/organic nanocomposites without aggregated inorganic components in the polymer phases are obtained. Briefly, the organic modification of inorganic components is the most important process prior to the preparation of inorganic/polymer nanocomposites.", "This study examines the bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). AEROSIL\u00ae R805, R812 and R972 were used as the three modified silicas, which were treated with amorphous silica, as indicated in [FIG1]\n                     . Numerous inorganic/PMMA nanocomposites have recently been investigated [BIB9 BIB10 BIB11 BIB12 BIB13 BIB14 BIB15], and found to exhibit some properties superior to those of pure PMMA. Silicas are commercially available and the effects between a modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix have been studied to improve their utility, related to mechanical properties, hardness and surface abrasion.", "Reliable kinetic parameters for the thermal degradation of silica/PMMA nanocomposites are determined. Even if the degradation has been extensively studied [BIB16 BIB17 BIB18 BIB19 BIB20 BIB21 BIB22 BIB23 BIB24], there are lots of investigations for the thermal degradation of inorganic/PMMA composites. Most researchers have examined layered silicate composites or the use of in situ sol\u2013gel processes to improve interactions to prepare silica/PMMA nanocomposites. The relationships between the properties of the polymer and the content of modifying silica are interesting. This paper describes a simple approach that involves adding modified silica to MMA solution to generate the silica/PMMA composites, and considers the relationships between the modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix, and mechanical and thermal behaviors."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials", ["Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was distillated twice before being used.

The storage modulus connects with the elastic modulus of the materials, and the loss modulus relates to the energy lost due to polymer chain movement. Below the glassy transition temperature, the silica/PMMA nanocomposites exhibit a high storage modulus. The storage moduli of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites at about 40\u00b0C are improved by introducing rigid silica particles. The stiffness associated with the modified silica particles dispersed well within the PMMA matrix causes the storage modulus to increase with silica content. The loss modulus of silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites at around 50\u00b0C also increases with the silica content because of the friction between the modified silica particles and the PMMA molecules when the silica particles are thoroughly dispersed in the PMMA matrix. The results reveal that the silica-R805 excellently reinforces the mechanical properties of pristine PMMA. The maximum <i>E</i>\u2033 in [FIG4] indicates that <i>T</i>\n                        g of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites increased with the silica content. The <i>T</i>\n                        g of these silica/PMMA composites exceeds that of pure PMMA because the well-dispersed silica layers restrict the mobility of the PMMA chain and the modified silica surface is entangled with the PMMA molecules.", "[FIG5] \n                        plots the dependence of tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> on temperature for silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites. The loss factor tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> is very sensitive to the structural transformation of the materials, and can be calculated from the ratio of the loss modulus to the storage modulus (<i>E</i>\u2033/<i>E</i>\u2032). Adding modified silica particles to the PMMA matrix shifts the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak values of these composites to the high-temperature region, implying an interaction between silica and the PMMA molecules. Increasing the silica content also broadens the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak, and lowers its intensity from 1.5 to 1.1. The breadth of the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak relates to the relaxation of the polymer chain. The adhesion between the modified surface of the silica particles and the PMMA molecules, and the constraints on the mobility of the polymer chains due to their being tethered to the inorganic particles widen the range of temperatures covered by the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak. Hence, the breadth of the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak increases with the silica content, and the height of the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak measures the energy-damping characteristics of a material. The silica particles are well dispersed in the PMMA matrix, so the rigid silica particles directly enhance the stiffness of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites. The height of the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i> peak thus declines as silica content increases.", "[FIG6] \n                        plots the relationship between the storage modulus of the variously modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites and the silica content. The storage modulus increased with the silica content for all modified silica/PMMA composites. Additionally, the moduli increased by about 30%, 40% and 56% for silica-R972/PMMA, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites, respectively, at a silica loading of 4 wt%. The silica-R805/PMMA composite has higher storage modulus than silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA composites, perhaps because the silica-R805 particles can be more easily dispersed effectively in the PMMA matrix, causing stronger interactions than the other two modified silicas, increasing the elastic modulus of the materials.", "[FIG7] \n                        reveals the maximum of the loss modulus of these modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites. All the loss moduli increased with the silica content. It can be observed that the loss modulus of the silica-R805/PMMA increases slightly with loading up to 2 wt%, and then rises rapidly as silica is added beyond 2 wt%. Unlike those of the other two composites, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA, the loss modulus increases smoothly. The phenomena may be attributed to the increase in the friction between the modified silica-R805 surface group (octane) and the PMMA molecules with the silica-R805 content above 2 wt%, and the fact that the interactions between the other two methyl groups on the modified silica-R812 and -R972 are weaker, even as the silica content is increased to 4 wt%.", "[FIG8] \n                        plots the relationship between the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                        g) of the differently modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites and the silica content.

The adhesion between the particles and PMMA molecules is strong, so <i>T</i>\n                        g of these composites increased with the polymer restriction of the chain by the modified silica particles and the dispersion of the silica particles in PMMA matrix.

The proportion of particles increased with the silica content, and the modified silica particles are well dispersed. The particles are sized between 70nm and 110nm. [FIG10] \n                        displays two different modified silica/PMMA composites and unmodified silica/PMMA composites with 4 wt% loading. These silica particles dispersed locally in the polymer phase, and the individual silica particles started to form large aggregations. A comparison with [FIG9 FIG10] clearly indicates that silica-R805 particles can disperse effectively in the PMMA matrix, but other kinds of silica (R812, R972 and unmodified silica) begin to aggregate into large silica particles. Accordingly, increasing the number of hydrophobic groups on the surface of silica can prevent the aggregation of the silica particles. The aggregation of the silica particles leads to poor properties of the silica/PMMA nanocomposites.", "Briefly, the mechanical properties of these modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites are related to the interactions between the alkyl group on the silica surface and the PMMA matrix; the effective dispersion of inorganic fillers greatly increases the surface area of the modified silica. Therefore, the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites have a higher storage modulus and loss modulus than silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA."]], ["Thermal properties of modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites", ["The thermal stability of silica/PMMA nanocomposites is governed by the modification of silica particles. Hence, the study of the thermal behaviors of silica particles is important. [FIG11] \n                        shows the TGA weight loss and derivative thermograms (DTG) for organically modified silica in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The major differences between these organic silicas arise in the temperature range 400\u2013600\u00b0C\u2014especially for silica-R805. The weight lost by the modified silica-R972 is very low between 50\u00b0C and 600\u00b0C. Any peaks in a derivative plot of this region reveal the presence of organic material. The organic constituent in organic silica-R805 starts to decompose at around 400\u00b0C, and the maximum in the derivative curve is at 525\u00b0C. Thus, the thermal stabilities of the modified silica are in the order R972>R812>R805.", "[FIG12] \n                        displays typical dynamic thermogravimetric TGA weight loss and derivative thermograms for variously modified silica/PMMA composites with 1 wt% added silica in a nitrogen environment. Pure PMMA decomposes in two stages: in the first stage, the weight loss gradually decreases as it is loaded with various organic silica composites. The thermal stability of pristine PMMA is related to the \u201cweak links\u201d in the radical-polymerized PMMA as the principal initiation sites of degradation [BIB20 BIB21 BIB22]. The second steps in degradation of PMMA are attributed to the presence of head-to-head linkages, the lack of saturation of the end groups related to the combination and termination of two radicals and random scission. The degradation behaviors of these composites in an environment of nitrogen are dissimilar. Interestingly, silica-R972/PMMA nanocomposite is more thermally stable than the other modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites, but does not have the most favorable mechanical characteristics. The mechanical properties connect with the entanglements between the modified silica particles and the PMMA chain motion, while the thermal resistance is related to the thermal stability of modified silica particles and the polymer matrix. Therefore, the silica-R805/PMMA has the most favorable mechanical properties and the silica-R972/PMMA is the most thermally stable.", "Aruchamy et al. [BIB30] and Morgan et al. [BIB31] also observed that unmodified silica/PMMA composites have higher decomposition temperatures than pure PMMA. Morgan et al. explained their results by the \u201ctrapping effect\u201d of SiO2 particles on the degradation products. Aruchamy and others [BIB30 BIB32 BIB33 BIB34] proposed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction between carbonyl groups in PMMA and Si\u2013OH groups on silica surfaces may explain the improved stability. PMMA forms hydrogen bonds with silica; this H-bonding influences the electron density in pairs of polymer molecules. This explanation is unlikely to pertain in this investigation because the Si\u2013OH group on the silica surface is unlikely to be present in the modified silica surface. The results indicate that the H-bonding might interrupt the depropagation of the chain. More interaction sites correspond to a higher decomposition temperature.", "[FIG13] \n                        plots the isothermal thermogravimetric curves for silica/PMMA nanocomposites variously modified at 220\u00b0C for 2h. The modified silica/PMMA composites decompose more slowly than the pure PMMA. Clearly, the silica-R972/PMMA composites have greater thermal resistance than other composites. The initial decomposition of the PMMA is accompanied by scission of the unsaturated end group. The silica particles in the polymer matrix trap the radicals and act as a gas barrier, preventing MMA monomers from permeating out of the silica/PMMA composites during thermal treatment. Hence, the rate of decomposition of the silica/PMMA composites is lower than that of the pure PMMA.", "[FIG14] \n                        indicates the effect of modified silica content on the thermal decomposition temperature at 5% and 10% weight loss of the composites. The temperature of degradation at 10% weight loss is approximately 20\u201330\u00b0C higher than that of pure PMMA. This result implies that a silica/PMMA nanocomposite is more thermally stable than pure PMMA. The effective dispersion of silica particles in the PMMA matrix enhances the thermal resistance of the silica/PMMA nanocomposites because increasing the number of active sites increases the decomposition temperature. Above 2 wt% silica loading, the decomposition temperature of these composites remains almost constant, perhaps because few silica particles are aggregated in the PMMA matrix. The rise in the decomposition temperature of the composites depends on both the dispersion behavior of the inorganic layers in the polymer matrix and the number of active sites in the silica particles that might trap radicals."]], ["Thermal degradation kinetics", ["The activation energy (<i>E</i>\n                        a) of degradation can be determined using the methods of Flynn [BIB25 BIB26 BIB27], Kissinger [BIB27 BIB28 BIB29] and Ozawa\u2013Flynn [BIB25 BIB26 BIB28].", "Flynn proposed the use of the non-isothermal differential weight loss (DTGA) method at a constant heating rate <i>\u03b2</i> to evaluate the activation energy.

The activation energies can be calculated from the slopes. [TBL1] \n                        lists the degradation activation energies of silica/PMMA composites with various silica contents. The activation energy of the silica/PMMA nanocomposites exceeds that of pure PMMA. This activation energy increases with the silica content. The pure PMMA has average activation energy 55kJ/mol. Three modified silica nanocomposites, silica-R972/PMMA, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R805/PMMA have activation energies in ranges 75\u201385kJ/mol, 73\u201382kJ/mol and 65\u201374kJ/mol, respectively. Undoubtedly, the modified silica/PMMA nanocomposite has a higher thermal resistance than pure PMMA. The groups on the silica surface also affect the thermal behavior. As the number of alkyl group on the modified silica surface increased, the activation energy declined. Thus, the order of effects of the alkyl group on silica surface to the thermal stability of silica/PMMA composites can be concluded as R972\u223cR812>R805.", "The second method involves non-isothermal TGA measurement, developed by Kissinger at a constant rate of degradation, to evaluate the average decomposition energy at weight losses between 0 and 20%. A plot of ln[(d<i>x</i>/d<i>T</i>)/(1\u2212<i>x</i>)] against 1/<i>T</i> yields a straight line that fits the data from the decomposition, the gradient of which provides the activation energy. [TBL2] \n                        summarizes the experimental results. The silica/PMMA has a mean activation energy of above 96\u2013126kJ/mol for silica-R972/PMMA, 92\u2013121kJ/mol for silica-R812/PMMA and 85\u201399kJ/mol for silica-R805/PMMA. The pure PMMA system has average activation energy of 72kJ/mol. These results conclude that the silica/PMMA nanocomposite system has a higher activation energy and thermal resistance than pure PMMA. A comparison of the ranges of activation energies of the modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites reveals clearly that the thermal stability of the modified silica on PMMA follows the order, silica-R972/PMMA\u223c-R812/PMMA>-R805/PMMA. The small aliphatic groups on the modified silica surface improve the thermal stability of PMMA. Thus, from the Kissinger analysis, it seems that the thermal stability of silica-R972/PMMA is slightly superior to silica-R812/PMMA composites, and both are much superior to silica-R805/PMMA.", "The third method examines multiple heating rate kinetics (MHRK). The activation energies of degradation calculated from TG curves are based on mass losses in different decomposition regions during degradation process. Accordingly, a series of experiments were performed at various heating rates, and <i>E</i>\n                        a was obtained from the slope of the linear isoconversion plot of ln(heating rate) against 1/<i>T</i>.

The activation energies of 5, 10, 15 and 20% conversions of silica/PMMA are in the range 81\u2013111kJ/mol, while those of pristine PMMA are between 53 and 67kJ/mol. The silica/PMMA nanocomposites are more thermally stable than pure PMMA. Furthermore, the aliphatic groups on the silica surface also affect the thermal resistance. The activation energy observably increased with percentage weight loss, and the thermal stabilities of the modified silica on PMMA follow the order silica-R972/PMMA\u223c-R812/PMMA>-R805/PMMA.", "In summary, three methods were used to determine the thermal stability of silica/PMMA nanocomposites. [TBL1] lists the activation energies of the initial degradation process (1\u20135% weight loss). The degradation proceeds as the temperature rises. [TBL2] summarizes the activation energies of propagation (at 0\u201320% weight loss). Finally, the activation energies of certain conversions (5, 10, 15, and 20% weight loss) are determined by MHRK technique. These activation energies increase with percentage weight loss ([TBL3]). The results are similar for all nanocomposites. Incorporating a small amount of certain modified silica into the polymer matrix during the polymerization of MMA increased PMMA's thermal stability. As the length of the alkyl chain on the modified silica surface increased, the low-temperature end-scission of PMMA gradually decreased and the degradation temperature increased, implying that the large surface area of the silica and the higher thermal stability associated with inorganic fillers affected the thermal behavior."]]]], ["Conclusion", ["This work considered three different specifics of modified silica particles in a PMMA matrix.
