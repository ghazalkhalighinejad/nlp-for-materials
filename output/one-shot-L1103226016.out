            "Description": "The dispersion of fillers in the epoxy micro/nano composites were investigated by examining the sample crosssections under a JEOL field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Samples of approximately 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm for microscopy are prepared by cutting the epoxy composites at different locations and analyzed. Representative SEM micrographs are shown in Figure 1 where the uniform dispersion of particles in the epoxy composites can be seen."

The error in the measurement is within 2%. For the dc volume resistivity measurements, a Keithley electrometer with 8009 resistivity measurement kit is used and a measurement protocol is followed. The readings are obtained under an applied voltage of 500 V dc."

            "Description": "The dielectric strength measurements in the present study are performed using a breakdown test cell designed with the appropriate electrodes as per ASTM D149 and the breakdown tests are carried out in a medium of transformer oil. The electrodes (both top and bottom) are cylindrical electrodes of 25 mm diameter with edges rounded to 3.2 mm. Proper care was taken to ensure that the transformer oil used in the experiments are pure (moisture and particle free). The sample was placed between the electrodes and the ac (50 Hz) voltage was continuously increased at a speed of 500 V/s till the sample broke down. The breakdown voltage, V (kV) of the samples are recorded and the dielectric strength, E (kV/mm) was calculated as E=V/t, where t is the thickness of the sample in millimeters. The dielectric strength data from this study are again presented in the form of Weibull plots."
