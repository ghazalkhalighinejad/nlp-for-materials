['Four kinds of core/shell Ag@C nanoparticles were employed. The diameters of the silver cores were distributed over 60 to 110 nm with an average diameter of 80–90 nm, but the thicknesses of the organic shells varied (Fig. 1). They are denoted as Shell_8 (ca. 8 nm),[15] Shell_13 (ca. 13 nm), Shell_60 (ca. 60 nm), and Shell_120 (ca. 120 nm), according to the thicknesses of their shells, hereafter. A typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the nanocomposites with Shell_8 Ag@C nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 2a, demonstrates that the nanoparticles are dispersed homogeneously in the epoxy matrix. The organic carbonaceous shells provide good compatibility between the silver cores and the epoxy matrix, resulting in a homogeneous dispersion of Ag@C nanoparticles in the polymer matrix even at high content.[15] The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, as shown in Figure 2b, illustrates that the silver cores of the Ag@C nanoparticles in the composites remain single crystals. Though the shells of the Ag@C nanoparticles in the nanocomposites are not visible in the TEM image (Fig. 2a), the existence and completeness of the organic shells in the nanocomposites can be confirmed by Raman spectra (Fig. 2c) of the nanocomposite films. Because of the surface-enhanced Raman effect, only the signals from the carbonaceous shells coated on the silver cores can be observed in the Raman spectra. In all spectra of these nanocomposites, two major peaks positioned at 1385 and 1595 cm–1 are common and can be attributed to the in-plane vibration of sp2 C\x01C bonds in disordered carbon and crystalline graphitic carbon, respectively. Different hydrothermal conditions in the synthesis of the core/shell nanoparticles lead to differences in the relative intensities of these two peaks for the four nanocomposites.[18] In addition to these two common peaks, two other characteristic peaks can be observed only in the Raman spectra of the nanocomposites filled with Ag@C particles with thinner shells, that is, Shell_8 and Shell_13, both of which exhibit almost the same feature (Shell_8 shown in Fig. 2c for instance). The strong peak at 2935 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of –CH2– groups in the skeletal chain of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) in both the shells and the epoxy matrix, and a minor peak at 1775 cm–1 in the spectra of the shell_8 nanocomposites shows that the PVP chains cling on the surface of the silver cores. These features demonstrate the incorporation of PVP chains in the organic shells and their coordination to the Ag surface,[19] making the shells of Shell_8 (and Shell_13) nanoparticles different from the other two nanoparticles. As for Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanoparticles, the carbonization process of glucose without the incorporation of PVP would result in more carbonization products in the final carbonaceous shells and, thus, would increase the conductivity of these thick shells. The resultant carbonaceous shells, especially in the case ofShell_8 and Shell_13 with the incorporation of PVP, could be a complex mixture of organic compounds.[18] The dependence of the dielectric constant, conductivity, and dielectric loss on the volume fraction of core/shell nanoparticles is shown in Figure 3 (with an experimental error of < 5 %). A large enhancement in the dielectric constant (Fig. 3a) in the vicinity of the percolation threshold can be observed in the nanocomposites. Although the dielectric constant of the epoxy matrix is the same for the four nanocomposites, εm = 3.7, the dielectric constant enhancement ε/εm for different composites is not the same. The difference between the thicknesses and conduction feature of the carbonaceous shells for these core/shell nanoparticles is responsible for this phenomenon. At the percolation threshold, the core/shell nanoparticles form a network connecting the top and bottom electrodes, and each interparticle junction can be treated as a nanocapacitor. From the top to bottom electrodes, these nanocapacitors are in series; thus, the dielectric constant ε of the nanocomposites can be expressed as: ε ≈ εs(1 + d/t) (2) where d is the diameter of the Ag cores, and t and es are the thickness and dielectric constant of the shells, respectively, if the conductivity of the cores is significantly much larger than that of the shells. This demonstrates that the dielectric constant of the composites can be tuned by varying the geometric parameters of the core/shell nanoparticles or choosing different shells with desired electrical properties. Thus, a variation in the thickness of the shells would change the dielectric constant of the nanocomposites. For the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites, by using the measured values of ε, and d/t ≈ 16 and 9 for Shell_8 and Shell_13, respectively, we can obtain εs ≈ 25 for Shell_8, and εs ≈ 23 for Shell_13, suggesting that the dielectric constants of these two shells are almost the same. The difference in ε/εm for the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites is caused by the variation in the thickness of the shells. If t and εs are fixed, the distribution in d would lead to increased ε because of the dominative effect of large d/t. Moreover, the shells in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites remain complete in the final composite films, as verified by the Raman spectra, preventing the Ag cores from being in direct contact with each other even at high Ag@C nanoparticle content. By this means, the nanocapacitor network in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites leads to stable dielectric constants even when f > fc, as shown in Figure 3a. Their conductivities mildly increase from 1.4 × 10–10 Scm–1 for the epoxy[20] to about 10–8–10–9 Scm– 1 at 1 kHz for the composites because of the presence of the insulating carbonaceous shells as interlayers between the Ag cores, as shown in Figure 3b. The dielectric loss of the composites remains less than 0.05 (Fig. 3c) in the volume fraction range. The insulating carbonaceous shells in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 particles are attributed to the incorporation of PVP, which leads to thinner polysaccharide shells. For the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanocomposites, e/em is smaller than that for the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites. Moreover, the dielectric constants of the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanocomposites drop seriously when f > fc (Fig. 3a), as is also observed in conventional percolative composites.[10,11] This decline in the dielectric constant is mainly caused by the high-conductivity shells in the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanoparticles, as the increase in the conductivity of these two composites is almost greater than four orders of magnitudes, from 1.4 × 10–10 Scm–1 to around 10–6 Scm–1, as shown in Figure 3b. Such large increases in the conductivity for the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanocomposites also lead to jumps of the dielectric loss values near the percolation threshold, for example, from 0.02 to over 0.08 (Fig. 3c). In order to further understand the differences between these composites, the current–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. 4) were measured. The breakdown fields of the nanocomposites with f > fc are estimated from Figure 4, that is, 1.1 MVm–1 for the Shell_8 and 1.4 MVm–1 for the Shell_13 nanocomposites, which means a breakdown voltage of ∼10 MVm–1 for the organic shells in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 cases. However, as is also the case for the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanocomposites, no abrupt increase in leakage current with applied voltage has been observed for these composites. Instead, the leakage current increases smoothly as the voltage increases, showing no obvious breakdown process. The conductivity of these nanocomposites can be estimated from the log–log plots of the I–V curves at low field: dc conductivity of the shell σsdc = 1.5 × 10–8 Scm–1 for the Shell_8 case, 2.5 × 10–9 Scm–1 for the Shell_13 case, 1.5 × 10–6 Scm–1 for the Shell_60 case, and 4.7 × 10–6 Scm–1 for the Shell_120 case, which agree well with the values obtained in Figure 3b. As discussed above, the insulating organic shells in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 cases can act as potential barriers between the Ag cores. Thus, above fc, the Shell_13 composite exhibits lower leakage conduction than the Shell_8 composite because of the thicker barrier layer in the Shell_13 case. On the contrary, carbonized shells without the incorporation of PVP, as in the Shell_60 and Shell_120 cases, cannot act as potential barriers but act instead as semiconducting paths due to their higher conductivity. Thus, the Shell_120 composite with thicker carbonized shells exhibits a conductivity value a little higher than that for the Shell_60 composite. We further observed the frequency dependencies of the dielectric constant and loss, as shown in Figure 5. The dielectric constants of the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites are almost independent of the frequency in the measured frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 MHz, while those of the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanocomposites start to drop above 1 MHz. The electric behavior of these Ag@C-filled composites can be simulated by a two-step method.[10] First, the equivalent complex conductivity of the Ag@C nanoparticles, σcs, can be expressed by using the Maxwell–Garnett equation as follows:[10]  where σs (= σsdc–iωεs) is the complex conductivity of the shells, rAg is the conductivity of the Ag cores, and p = (d/(2t+d))3. Second, according to the self-consistent effective medium approximation, the effective complex conductivity of the nanocomposites, σ*, can be written as follows:[10]  where σm (= σmdc–iωεm) is the complex conductivity of the polymer matrix. For illustration, the calculated frequency-dependent dielectric behavior for the Shell_8 composites is shown in Figure 6. As shown, the dielectric relaxation frequency for this case is over 1013 Hz, much higher than the current measured frequency range, which agrees well with the experimental results. Dielectric relaxation is not observed in the pure epoxy matrix in the measured frequency range, as shown in Figure 5a, so the decline in the dielectric constants for the Shell_60 and Shell_120 composites can also be attributed to the difference between the carbonaceous shells of these nanoparticles. As for the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanoparticles, the conductivity of the shells are over two to three orders of magnitudes higher than those for the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanoparticles. The dielectric relaxation could thus shift to lower frequency, leading to the decline in the dielectric constant of the Shell_60 and Shell_120 composites in the measured frequency range. The dielectric relaxation in the shells of the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanoparticles is thus responsible for the increase in dielectric loss with frequency (Fig. 5b). The dielectric loss of the Shell_8 and Shell_13 composites remains stable, as does that for the epoxy. The dielectric constants measured for these nanocomposites all show a rather flat temperature dispersion within 5% in the measured range of 25–120 °C, as shown in Figure 7a. A similar flat electric-field dispersion is observed in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 composites from 0 to 3500 Vcm–1, while an obvious decline in the dielectric constant of the Shell_60 and Shell_120 composites is observed as the electric field increases caused by the higher conductivity of the shells for the Shell_60 and Shell_120 nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 7b.']
