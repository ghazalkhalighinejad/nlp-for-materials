['The carbonaceous shells coating the silver cores play a dominative role in determining the dielectric behavior of the Ag@Câ€“polymer nanocomposites. The insulating shells isolate the silver cores from each other, forming nanocapacitor networks in the polymer matrix and give rise to enhanced and stable dielectric constants even when f > fc. Tunable dielectric constants have been achieved in the Shell_8 and Shell_13 nanocomposites by adjusting the thickness of the organic insulating shells, and their dielectric constants are almost independent of the frequency over a very wide frequency range. On the other hand, the shells with higher conductivity could deteriorate the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites, leading to unstable dielectric constant near fc and large dielectric loss, much like the conventional percolative composites. The present approach may be extended to the fabrication of similar hybrid composites with potential applications by the proper choice of materials and dimension-tuning of both core and shell, as well as choosing from a broad selection of polymers as the matrix.
