Dielectric Properties of Epoxy Nanocomposites
The dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites with insulating nano-fillers, viz., TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3 were investigated at low filler concentrations by weight. Epoxy nanocomposite samples with a good dispersion of nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix were prepared and experiments were performed to measure the dielectric permittivity and tan delta (400 Hz-1 MHz), dc volume resistivity and ac dielectric strength. At very low nanoparticle loadings, results demonstrate some interesting dielectric behaviors for nanocomposites and some of the electrical properties are found to be unique and advantageous for use in several existing and potential electrical systems. The nanocomposite dielectric properties are analyzed in detail with respect to different experimental parameters like frequency (for permittivity/tan delta), filler size, filler concentration and filler permittivity. In addition, epoxy microcomposites for the same systems were synthesized and their dielectric properties were compared to the results already obtained for nanocomposites. The interesting dielectric characteristics for epoxy based nanodielectric systems are attributed to the large volume fraction of interfaces in the bulk of the material and the ensuing interactions between the charged nanoparticle surface and the epoxy chains.
