High Dielectric Performance of Polymer Composite Films Induced by a Percolating Interparticle Barrier Layer**
 Polymer composites containing hybrid particles with an organic carbonaceous shell coating on Ag cores were prepared by low-cost solution processing. A stable high dielectric constant κ and low dielectric loss tan δ (see figure) were observed because of percolating interparticle barrier layers provided by the core/shell particles.
