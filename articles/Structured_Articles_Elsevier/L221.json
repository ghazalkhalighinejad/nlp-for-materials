First, the quaternary alkylphosphonium and alkylammonium salt were both used as the intercalating agents separately for the preparation of organophilic clay through the cationic exchange reactions with Na+-montmorillonite clay. Subsequently, the organophilic clay was blent into the epoxy resin through <i>in-situ</i> thermal ring-opening polymerizations to prepare a series of polymer-clay nanocomposite (PCN) materials. The as-synthesized PCN materials were subsequently characterized by Fourier-Transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction (WXRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n                  It should be noted that the quaternary alkylphosphonium salt (\u03a63P+-C12)-modified clay was found to show better dispersion capability than that of quaternary alkylammonium salt (Me3N+-C16)-modified clay existed in the polymer matrix based on the studies of WXRD and TEM. The better dispersion of (\u03a63P+-C12)-modified clay in epoxy resin was found to lead more effectively enhanced physical property such as corrosion protection, gas barrier, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and flame retardant properties of polymers than that of (Me3N+-C16)-modified clay, in the form of coating and membrane, based on the measurements of a series of electrochemical corrosion parameters, gas permeability analysis (GPA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and limiting oxygen index (LOI), respectively.

Typically, the chemical structures of MMT consist of two fused silica tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an edge-shared octahedral sheet of either magnesium or aluminum hydroxide. The Na+ and Ca2+ residing in the interlayer regions usually can be replaced by organic cations such as alkylammonium ions by a cationic-exchange reaction to render the hydrophilic-layered silicate organophilic. The organophilically charged clay layers exchanged by cationic surfactants playing an important role for the intercalation.", "In the past decades, thermosetting polymers such as epoxy resin, polyimide or phenolic resins attracted many chemists, physicists, and material scientists devoting efforts to study their nanocomposites. Among these thermosets, epoxy resins evoked intensive studies much in the preparation of nanocomposite materials lately due to their high tensile strength, and modulus, good adhesive properties, good chemical, and corrosion resistance, low shrinkage in cure, and excellent dimensional stability. Up to date, many published literatures in terms of the investigations focused on the investigations of epoxy resin-clay nanocomposite materials have been reported and concentrated mainly on the exploration of mechanical and thermal properties based on the comparative studies between nanocomposites containing raw Na+-MMT and organophilic clay [bib11].

The corrosion of these samples in 5wt% NaCl aqueous electrolyte for 30min was followed by EIS. The charge-transfer resistances of those samples as determined by the intersection of the high-frequency end from the low-frequency end of the semicircle arc with the real axis were 1.03, 10.6, 90.9, 148, 490, and 600k\u03a9cm2, respectively [bib19].

EIS Bode plots (impedance vs. frequency) of samples (a\u2013f) were shown in [fig7]\n                        . In conclusion, the PCN coatings containing quaternary phosphonium salt-modified clay exhibited better corrosion protection performance on CRS coupons than that with quaternary ammonium salt-modified clay based on the electrochemical corrosion parameter measurements such as Tafel plot, Bode plot, Nyquist plot, etc. The effective enhancement of anticorrosion effect for the TECP coatings system as compared to that of TECN system might have arisen from dispersing silicate nanolayers of clay in an epoxy resin matrix, leading to a much increase for the tortuosity of diffusion pathway of oxygen and water vapor. This can be further identified by the studied of O2 and H2O molecular barrier effect as discussed in the next section."]], ["Barrier properties", ["As far as the results of anticorrosion properties were concerned, the favors penetration reduction by forcing diffusing molecules (i.e., a nematic phase) to make long detours round the platelets and changes in the local permeability [bib20]. The membranes used for the molecular permeability measurements were prepared to have a thickness of ca. \u223c0.175mm. For the oxygen and water vapor permeability studies, meanwhile, we found that the incorporation of different organophilic clay into epoxy resin matrix results in a distinct reduction of barrier properties for epoxy resin-clay nanocomposite membranes, as listed in [fig8]\n                        . Compared to that pure epoxy resin, free-standing films of TECP and TECN system at clay loading (e.g., 7wt%) showed 86.1% and 66% reduction of oxygen permeability, respectively. Nevertheless, it should be further noted that an immense decrease in the amount of TECP7 was 92.58g/m2-h extremely for the water vapor permeability studies, as illustrated in [tbl1]. For these, one factor should be considered, namely a geometric factor about the rigid phenyl group and long-chain alkyl group pendant in dodecyltriphenyl-phosphonium salt, could significantly result in an exfoliated clay structure [bib21]."]], ["Thermal and dynamic mechanical properties", ["The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                        g) based on the DSC evaluations was found to increase form 83.63\u00b0C of neat polymer up to 120.46\u00b0C of TECP7, as shown in [fig9]\n                         and [tbl2]\n                        . The effectively enhanced <i>T</i>\n                        g of TECP7 may probably associated with the good dispersion of quaternary phosphonium salt-modified clay in polymer framework, which led to a large interfacial contact area between the inorganic clay platelets and organic epoxy resin matrix. Furthermore, the highly dense network of epoxy resin was also favored the interactions between the clay nano-layers by its homopolymerization within the clay galleries, and then polymer chains may be tied through the surface of the silicate by electrostatic interaction, thus increasing the surrounding entanglements [bib22 bib23].", "Subsequently, the thermo-mechanical properties of composite materials were also investigated through the performing of DMA tests using a tension mode. Typically, two different moduli, i.e., elastic or storage modulus (<i>E</i>\u2032) and an imaginary (loss) modulus (<i>E</i>\u2032\u2032) were identified in the curves of DMA thermograms. The ratio E\u2032/E\u2032\u2032, which typically reached a maximum point, was called tan delta (tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i>) and employed as glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                        g) of as-tested polymer. The curves in [fig10]\n                         illustrated the dependence of the storage modulus and the tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i>, respectively. The data also summarized the storage modulus values for the PCN materials at 35\u00b0C (glassy region, below <i>T</i>\n                        g) and at 130\u00b0C (rubbery region, above <i>T</i>\n                        g), along with the <i>T</i>\n                        g values obtained from the maximum in tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i>, as shown in [tbl2]. The storage moduli of as-prepared materials in the glassy region, the superior dispersion of \u03a63P+-C12-modified clay in epoxy resin matrix led to an effective enhancement of mechanical strength. For example, the storage modulus was increased from the neat epoxy resin matrix of 2311MPa up to TECP7 of 3597MPa. Furthermore, the incorporation of organophilic clay in polymer matrix also exhibit significant improvements of mechanical strength of neat polymer matrix in the rubbery region shown in [tbl2] for the evaluation of tan\n                        <i>\u03b4</i>. For example, the <i>T</i>\n                        g of the TECP7 was found to be higher than TECN7, which is probably due to the Brownian motion of network chains [bib18], and the results were consistent with our previous DSC studies."]], ["Thermal stability and flame retardant performance", ["In the subsequent thermal property studies, enhancement of thermal stability, and thermal degradation behavior of polymer matrix via the formation of epoxy resin-clay nanocomposite materials was determined by thermal decomposition temperatures (<i>T</i>\n                        d) of as-prepared materials in TGA thermograms, as measured under an air atmosphere. In general, there appeared to be three stages of weight loss starting at \u223c150\u00b0C and ending at 800\u00b0C, which might be correspondent to the degradation of intercalation agents (i.e., 150\u2013250\u00b0C) followed by the structural decomposition of uncrosslinked (i.e., 250\u2013450\u00b0C) and crosslinked (i.e., 500\u2013650\u00b0C) component of epoxy resin, as shown in [fig11]\n                         \n                        [bib24 bib25 bib26].", "The flammability properties of the PCN materials were examined by measuring their corresponding LOI value. A significant increase in LOI value was observed as the organophilic clay was effectively dispersed in the epoxy resin matrix. For example, the LOI value of TECN7 and TECP7 was equal to 24.5 and 27.5, respectively, which was obviously higher than that of neat epoxy resin (i.e., LOI=19). The higher LOI value of TECP7 as compared to that of TECN7, as shown in [tbl2], may be probably due to the better organophilic clay dispersion of TECP7 in epoxy resin. In conclusion, the incorporation of organophilic clay into the epoxy resin matrix may exhibit a useful effect on leveling up the flame retardancy of the PCN materials."]]]], ["Conclusion", ["In this article, a series of comparative studies for the effect of intercalating agent on the physical properties of the epoxy resin-clay based nanocomposite materials were performed. The quaternary alkylphosphonium and alkyl ammonium salt were both used as the intercalating agents separately for the preparation of organophilic clay through the cationic exchange reactions with Na+-MMT clay, followed by blending the organophilic clay into the epoxy monomer and hardener through the thermal ring-opening polymerizations to give a series of PCN materials. The as-prepared materials were subsequently characterized by the sequential studies of FTIR spectroscopy, Wide-angle XRD diffraction and TEM. The morphological images for the organophilic clay was evidenced that the quaternary alkylphosphonium salt-modified clay (TECP system) exhibited a better dispersion capability in epoxy resin matrix than that of quaternary alkylammonium salt-modified clay (TECN system). The better dispersion of TECP system may lead to a larger interfacial contact area between the inorganic clay platelets and organic polymeric matrix, reflecting a remarkable enhancement of physical properties as compared to that of TECN system. For example, at same clay loading, all TECP system exhibited a better performance on corrosion protection, gas barrier, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and flame retardant properties as compared to that of TECN system based on the studies of a series of electrochemical corrosion parameter measurements, gas permeability analysis (GPA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and limiting oxygen index (LOI) test, respectively. Furthermore, effect of material composition on the physical properties of as-prepared materials was also investigated. The loading increase of organophilic clay in PCN materials usually accompanied with an increased of physical properties as mentioned in the previous sections."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2008.06.015"}
