Among the nanocomposite materials, one of the most widely studied is silica-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) because of its optical and mechanical properties [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5]. In fact, the silica nanoparticles incorporated into the polymer matrix can improve the strength, the abrasion-resistance and the aging-resistance of the polymer. The nanocomposite properties are strongly dependent on \u201cmolecular\u201d properties, and in particular on the nature and dimensions of the organic\u2013inorganic interfaces, on the mechanisms of interaction between the organic and inorganic components, and on the structural and dynamic properties of either the organic or inorganic phases. However, the incomplete condensation and poor thermal stability of PMMA has a negative influence on the optical and thermal properties of the composites, even if properties like the surface hardness increases with an increase in the amount of silica [bib4].", "Several methods have been used to prepare nanocomposites: solution mixing, physical mixing, <i>in</i> \n                     <i>situ</i> polymerization and single-screw extrusion [bib6 bib7 bib8]. Ma et\u00a0al. [bib9] prepared polyacrylate\u2013silica nanocomposites by a sol\u2013gel process <i>via in situ</i> emulsion polymerization. Yu et\u00a0al. [bib10] synthesized surface-modified silica particles and copolymerized the obtained nanoparticles with MMA monomers. Freris et\u00a0al. [bib11] performed the polymer encapsulation of submicrometer-sized silica particles by the synthesis of the polymer shell, poly(methyl methacrylate), under static conditions in a reaction medium free of surfactants and stabilizing agents. Preparation of SiO2\u2013PMMA nanocomposites <i>via in situ</i> emulsion polymerization in the presence of an initiator was investigated [bib3 bib12 bib13 bib14]. It was found that the presence of silica retarded the thermal decomposition of the polymer chains, which was related to the large silica surface area, to radicals probably trapped by silica during degradation and to uncondensed residue of the precursor which needed a large amount of heat to decompose. The storage and loss modulus, glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     \n                        <i>g</i>\n                     ) and activation energy of all the composites increased with the amount of silica. An increase in the thermal stability and activation energy with chain length of the organic molecules was observed when organically modified silica was used [bib3]. However, the opposite trend where the presence of silica in PMMA did not enhance the thermal stability was also observed [bib15 bib16]. Some authors, studying the thermal degradation kinetics, have reported that the addition of silica could also lead to a decreased activation energy of degradation [bib17].", "An improvement in thermal stability with an increase in silica content was observed in silica\u2013PMMA nanocomposites prepared by using single-screw extrusion [bib18 bib19]. The nanocomposites showed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and thermal stabilities, although they were not strictly flame retardant when subjected to fire tests like limiting oxygen index or horizontal Bunsen burner tests.", "The purpose of this study was to prepare silica\u2013PMMA nanocomposites through a melt compounding method by using chemically modified SiO2 nanoparticles. Both nanoparticles and composites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), FTIR spectroscopy and 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR) and measures of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1<i>\u03c1</i>\n                     (<i>H</i>)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1(<i>H</i>)) and cross-polarization times (<i>T</i>\n                     CH).

Above the glass transition temperature the 1 and 2% silica containing nanocomposites still have storage moduli below that of PMMA, but the 5% containing nanocomposite has higher storage modulus values. It seems as if effective immobilization of the polymer chains only takes place at the higher silica quantities. The loss modulus of the composites, shown in [fig3]B, follows the same trend as the storage modulus. In this case, however, the glass transition temperatures for both the 2% and 5% silica containing composites are higher than that of pure PMMA, indicating that effective immobilization already starts when 2% nanoparticles are introduced into the polymer. The tan <i>\u03b4</i> curves, shown in [fig3]C, confirm the observation from the loss modulus curves.", "The TGA curves of the pure PMMA and of silica\u2013PMMA composites having 1, 2 and 5wt.% of SiO2 performed at a heating rate of 10\u00b0Cmin\u22121 are reported in [fig4]\n                     .", "All the samples show a single-step degradation, and this degradation step clearly moves to higher temperatures with increasing silica amount, with that for the 5% silica containing sample significantly (about 10\u00b0C) higher than those for the other samples.", "The most commonly used approaches to determine the apparent kinetic parameters are the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and the Freidman and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods for polymer degradation [bib24 bib25 bib26]. Vyazovkin et\u00a0al. [bib27] recommend the KAS method for accuracy of activation energy values. In this work the KAS and FWO methods were used.", "From the dynamic TGA curves of PMMA, silica\u2013PMMA (2 and 5wt.%) at heating rates of 3, 5, 7 and 9\u00b0Cmin\u22121 the isoconversional graphs of ln<i>\u03b2 versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> according to Equation [fd1] were plotted ([fig5 fig6]\n                     \n                     ), as well as ln(<i>\u03b2</i>/<i>T</i>\n                     2) <i>versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> according to Equation [fd2] ([fig7 fig8]\n                     \n                     ).", "The activation energy values were calculated from the slopes of the isoconversional plots. Both isoconversional methods give similar values of the activation energies within experimental uncertainty. [fig9]\n                      illustrates the relationship between the activation energies and the degree of conversion.", "The activation energies of degradation of PMMA increased with an increase in the degree of conversion, while those of PMMA-silica (5wt.%) decreased. The silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%) shows lower activation energies of degradation up to around 40% mass loss ([fig9]), while at higher degrees of conversion those of silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%) are higher. In the case of pure PMMA the decrease in activation energy is probably the result of an increase in the number of free radicals with increasing degree of conversion, which accelerates the degradation process. In the presence of the nanoparticles, however, it seems as if (at least initially) the nanoparticles act as catalysts so that less energy is needed to initiate the degradation process, but as the degradation proceeds, the interaction between the nanoparticles and the escaping monomer traps the volatile degradation product and increases the observed activation energy. Similar results were found in other studies, but the observed trends were not clearly explained by the authors [bib28 bib29]. However, Vyazovkin et\u00a0al. [bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31] related the dependence of activation energy on degree of conversion to competing reactions in the degradation process. According to them the presence of silica seems to catalyze the degradation process by giving an alternative degradation route. In the presence of silica, certain intermediates are apparently formed with increasing <i>\u03b1</i>, that decompose first and require a lower <i>E</i>\n                     \n                        <i>a</i>\n                     .", "TGA-FTIR analyses were done to establish the nature of the degradation product(s), and to confirm the observations from the kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation process of PMMA and silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%). [fig10]\n                      shows the FTIR spectra of the degradation products of pure PMMA at different temperatures during the degradation process.", "All the spectra almost perfectly matches the known spectrum of methyl methacrylate (MMA), which confirms the primary degradation as that of de-polymerization. The peak around 2966cm\u22121 is assigned to the CH3 and CH2 stretching vibrations, whereas their bending vibration appeared around 1451cm\u22121 for CH2 and 1314cm\u22121 for CH3. In addition, the carbonyl absorption vibration appeared around 1744cm\u22121 and the stretching vibration for C\u2013O was around 1167cm\u22121. No new peaks or peak shifts were observed for the nanocomposite samples. There is a clear increase in peak intensity for all the characteristic peaks with increasing temperature, it reaches a maximum, and decreases again with further increase in temperature. The silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%) sample shows the same spectra and a similar trend ([fig11]\n                     ).", "When the spectra of PMMA, silica\u2013PMMA (2 and 5wt.%), obtained at the same temperature, are compared ([fig12]\n                     ), it is clear that there is a decrease in peak intensity with increasing amount of silica.", "Although the presence of silica nanoparticles clearly did not change the polymerization mechanism, it clearly had an influence on either the temperature range during which depolymerization occurs, and/or on the ease with which the volatile MMA monomer is released during the degradation process. Whatever the reason for the delayed mass loss, the interaction between PMMA or MMA and the silica nanoparticles could play a significant role in changing the degradation kinetics.", "Thus, XRD and 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR measurements were performed in order to attempt a correlation between the mechanical properties and the structure of the nanocomposites.

The diffraction pattern of PMMA shows a broad diffraction peak at 2<i>\u03b8</i>\n                     =14, typical of an amorphous material, together with two bands of lower intensities centered at 29.7 and 41.7 [bib32]. The diffraction pattern of the silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%) sample shows the same three bands observed in the pure PMMA, indicating that neither the orientation of the PMMA chains nor the amorphous structure of the silica was influenced during the preparation process.", "Notwithstanding, detailed information on the physical\u2013chemical environment of each component (nanoparticles and polymer) cannot be obtained by the above experiment. To gain insight into the organization of the polymer molecules in contact with the nanoparticle surface, 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR experiments were performed. The 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR spectra of PMMA and of the silica\u2013PMMA (5wt.%) are shown in [fig14]\n                     .", "Five peaks are present in all the spectra: peak 1 at 17ppm is related to the methyl group, peak 2 at 45ppm to the methylene group, peak 3 at 52ppm to the quaternary carbon of the polymeric chain, peak 4 at 56ppm to the methoxyl group and peak 5 at 177ppm to the carbonyl carbon, according to literature [bib33]. No modification in the chemical shift and in the band shape is observed after composite formation, indicating that no chemical modification occurred in the polymer.", "Thus, the spin-lattice relaxation time, in the laboratory frame <i>T</i>\n                     1(<i>H</i>) and in the rotating frame <i>T</i>\n                     1<i>\u03c1</i>\n                     (<i>H</i>), and the cross-polarization time <i>T</i>\n                     CH were determined through solid-state NMR measurements in order to evaluate the dynamic modifications occurring in the polymeric chain of the PMMA matrix after composite formation.
