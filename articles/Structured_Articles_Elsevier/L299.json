PEMs function as conductive proton mediums, as well as barriers to avoid direct contact between the fuel and oxidant. In order to alleviate the effect of CO poisoning in electrodes and to improve the power density of the fuel cells, the operating temperature has been proposed to be maintained above 100\u00b0C. The perfluorosulfonic acid polymer membranes, such as Nafion\u00ae, are typically used as the electrolytes in PEMFCs, because of their outstanding chemical stability and high proton conductivity. However, the Nafion\u00ae membranes have two major drawbacks: (i) loss of proton conductivity at temperatures above 100\u00b0C due to dehydration phenomena; (ii) high methanol permeation, which causes loss of fuel and decreases cathode performance in PEMFCs [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7]. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a very promising material for high-temperature (>100\u00b0C) fuel cell applications, because of its high thermal stability and good mechanical properties. In addition, PBI doped with strong acids has stable proton conductivity at temperatures higher than 100\u00b0C [bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16].", "The preparation of hybrid organic\u2013inorganic composites has been developed and studied during the last decade, because hybrids show controllable chemical and physical properties by combining the effects of organic polymers and inorganic compounds [bib17 bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23]. Several studies have showed that the presence of silica particles in the organic polymer matrix can reduce the methanol permeability of the hybrids due to the dispersed silica particles acting as methanol barriers [bib24 bib25 bib26]. Therefore, the polymer/silica hybrid membranes have the potential for use as PEMs.", "In this study, we have prepared novel PBI/silica hybrid membranes using a silica precursor, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), via a sol\u2013gel process in a PBI solution, followed by solution casting. The PBI used in this research is an amorphous, organosoluble fluorine-containing PBI. Compared to the most commonly PBI used in PEMFCs, poly[2,2\u2032-(<i>m</i>-phenylene)-5,5\u2032-bibenzimidazole], which is difficult to dissolve in common organic solvents due to its very rigid molecular structure, the fluorine-containing PBI is soluble in several organic solvents. It could be used to prepare PBI/silica hybrid membranes through the sol\u2013gel process. However, the great difference in the properties of polymer and silica materials may cause phase separation. In order to avoid phase separation, some papers have reported that a bonding agent can be added to bond the organic moiety and the inorganic phase [bib27 bib28 bib29]. To achieve this objective, a fluorine-containing PBI copolymer containing hydroxyl groups was synthesized in this research to provide the bonding sites for the bonding agent. The fluorine-containing PBI copolymer had good compatibility with the inorganic silica phase. Here, we report the mechanical properties, thermal properties and methanol permeability of the PBI/silica hybrid membranes.

The tensile moduli and strength of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites increased with the increase of silica content up to a silica content of 10wt.%. These reinforcing effects might result from the interfacial interaction between PBI chains and silica particles. The moduli of PBI10OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites increased 17 and 37% compared to the pure PBI10OH and PBI30OH copolymers, respectively. The larger increase in modulus of PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites could be attributed to more hydroxyl groups being presented in the PBI30OH as bonding sites to the silica phase. The modulus of the PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites without bonding agents increased only by 11% compared to the pure PBI30OH due to the lack of strong interfacial interactions between the PBI chains and the silica particles. Both the tensile moduli and strength of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites slightly decreased when the silica content reached 15wt.%. The phenomenon might be caused by a few agglomerated nanosized silica particles in the polymer matrix.", "[tbl3 tbl4] also summarize the tensile properties of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites doped with phosphoric acid. It was found that the tensile moduli and strength of the nanocomposites decreased when they were doped with phosphoric acid. This could be due to the plasticizing effect from the phosphoric acid. However, the PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites doped with phosphoric acid still retained sufficient mechanical properties for use as proton exchange membranes."]], ["Methanol permeability of PBI/silica nanocomposite membranes", ["[fig11]\n                         shows the methanol permeability of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites. The methanol permeability of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites decreased with increasing amounts of silica up to a silica content of 10wt.%. It indicated that the methanol permeability of the nanocomposites decreased due to the silica particles acting as methanol barriers in the polymer matrix. The methanol permeability of PBI10OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites decreased 39 and 58% relative to the pure PBI10OH and PBI30OH copolymers, respectively. The larger decrease in methanol permeability of PBI30OH/10wt.% silica nanocomposites could be attributed to more hydroxyl groups in the PBI30OH acting as bonding sites to the silica phase. However, a further increase in silica loading to 15wt.% did not have any additional decrease in methanol permeability. This might be caused by a few agglomerated nanosized silica particles in the polymer matrix. [fig12]\n                         shows the methanol permeability of PBI10OH/silica nanocomposites and PBI30OH/silica nanocomposites doped with phosphoric acid. Compared to [fig11], it was found that the methanol permeability of the nanocomposites increased when they were doped with phosphoric acid. The increase in the methanol crossover in the acid-doped PBI/silica hybrid membranes could be due to the increase in the free volume of PBI after phosphoric acid doping because the protonation of PBI molecules could reduce the intermolecular interaction forces. Even though the permeability of the acid-doped PBI/silica hybrid membranes increased, it was still much lower than that of the Nafion\u00ae 117 membrane. We have used the same method to measure the permeability of the Nafion\u00ae 117 membrane, and found that it was 30\u00d710\u22128\n                        cm2/s, as described in our previous paper [bib40]."]], ["Conductivity of PBI/silica nanocomposite membranes", ["[fig13]\n                         shows the proton conductivities of PBI30OH/silica nanocomposite membranes doped with different amounts of phosphoric acid. The measurement was taken at 160\u00b0C under anhydrous condition, because the conductivity of the acid-doped PBI decreased above 160\u00b0C due to the dehydration of the phosphoric acid, which turned into H4P2O7. Compared with that of the acid-doped PBI membranes, the conductivity of the Nafion\u00ae 117 membrane declined abruptly above 80\u00b0C, because of dehydration. The conductivity of the Nafion\u00ae 117 membrane could not be measured at 160\u00b0C, because it lost proton conductive ability above 100\u00b0C. The above-mentioned detail was discussed in our previous research [bib40]. The conductivities of the acid-doped PBI30OH/silica nanocomposite membranes increased with the doping level of phosphoric acid. However, the conductivities of the nanocomposite films were slightly lower than that of the acid-doped pure PBI30OH membranes, because the silica particles in the polymer matrix might retard the mobility of protons in the membranes. It decreased by 22\u201328% with respect to the acid-doped pure PBI30OH membranes."]]]], ["Conclusions", ["PBI/silica nanocomposite membranes can be prepared via sol\u2013gel process from a fluorine-containing PBI copolymer with TEOS and a bonding agent due to the solubility of the fluorine-containing PBI copolymer. The introduction of the bonding agent results in the reinforcing interfacial interaction between PBI chains and the silica nanoparticles. The addition of silica can enhance the mechanical properties of the PBI membranes, and reduce the methanol permeability. Although the conductivity is slightly decreased by the silica, the overall performance of the nanocomposite membranes is still obviously improved by the addition of silica. The PBI/silica nanocomposite membranes have the potential for use as proton exchange membranes in high-temperature PEMFC."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.memsci.2007.08.033"}
