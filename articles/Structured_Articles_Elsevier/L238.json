{"title": "Improvements and mechanisms of fracture and fatigue properties of well-dispersed alumina/epoxy nanocomposites", "abstract": "In an earlier paper [Zhao S, Schadler LS, Hillborg H, Auletta T, Duncan R. Mechanisms leading to improved mechanical performance in nanoscale alumina filled epoxy. Compos Sci Technol 2008], a model system of nanoscale alumina filled bisphenol A based epoxy with two interface conditions was used to highlight the mechanisms leading to significant improvements in ductility, tensile toughness and modulus. In this paper, the fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation (FCP) rate of the materials used in the preceding paper were measured as a function of interface condition to gain further insight into the mechanisms leading to enhanced mechanical performance. No significant improvement in fracture toughness or fracture energy was observed. A significant improvement in FCP resistance was observed for both nanocomposites, but the improvement was larger for the composites with a stronger particle/matrix interface. The crack arresting mechanisms include particle matrix debonding, plastic void growth, and in the nanocomposites with a stronger interface, significant plastic deformation of the matrix around the well-bonded nanoparticles.", "body": [["Introduction", ["In the preceding paper [bib1], the mechanisms leading to enhanced ductility in nanoscale alumina/epoxy matrices was reported. Two interface conditions were investigated: the nascent interface, which lead to a weak interface, and a silane modified interface with covalent bonding to the epoxy. Particle debonding, plastic void growth and crack deflection were present in both composites, but both plastic void growth and crack deflection were more prevalent for the stronger interface condition. In this paper, the fracture and fatigue crack propagation behavior of the nanocomposites were studied in order to gain further insight into the mechanisms leading to improved mechanical performance.", "Brittle epoxies are often toughened using micron-sized soft rubber particles or rigid particles [bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6]. However the stiffness or ductility is often reduced due to the addition of the soft or rigid fillers. Recently, nanosized fillers have been shown to increase toughness, modulus, and ductility simultaneously [bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10]. There have been several reports of improved ductility and toughness in brittle thermoset polymers due to the addition of equiaxed nanoparticles. Kinloch et al. [bib11] showed that the addition of a low concentrations of nanosilica (SiO2) particles to a typical rubber-toughened epoxy, based upon a two-part epoxy formulation, lead to a significant increase in the fracture toughness or energy (<i>K</i>\n                     Ic or <i>G</i>\n                     Ic) of the resin. In addition [bib12], the value of <i>G</i>\n                     Ic increased from 103J/m2 for the pure epoxy polymer to over 1400J/m2 upon the formation of the \u2018hybrid\u2019 material containing both rubbery micron-sized particles and nano-SiO2 particles in a hot-cured single-part epoxy. Plastic deformation of the matrix, crack deflection and twisting around particles, and crack front pinning by rigid particles were the main toughening mechanisms of this \u2018hybrid\u2019 epoxy polymer. Johnsen et al. [bib13] reported that the fracture toughness, <i>K</i>\n                     Ic, increased significantly for nanosilica filled epoxy compared with the neat polymer. They reported that the primary toughening mechanism was plastic void growth. Wetzel et al. [bib14] showed that the fracture toughness, <i>K</i>\n                     Ic, of nanoalumina filled epoxy composite increased by 60% at a filler content of 5 vol.%; the FCP resistance of the nanocomposites also improved. They attributed the improvement to crack deflection, plastic deformation and crack pinning. More recently, Blackman et al<i>.</i> \n                     [bib15] reported a significant improvement in both the initial toughness, <i>K</i>\n                     Ic, and the cyclic-fatigue behavior, threshold \n                        \n                           \u0394\n                           \n                              \n                                 K\n                              \n                              \n                                 th\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                     , of the epoxy by introducing nanosilica. This result is noteworthy, however the mechanism leading to the improvement of the fatigue behavior was not mentioned.", "The different mechanisms observed by these authors may be due to differences in the strength of the interface between the nanoparticles and the matrix. The relationship between the strength of the interface for nanoscale fillers and toughening mechanisms is not well understood. This paper attempts to clarify the mechanisms operating in nanofilled composite for two interface conditions. The strong interface was achieved by silane surface treatment of the nanoparticles, however the untreated nanoparticles led to the weak interface."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials and sample preparation", ["The same materials used in the preceding paper [bib1] were used here, including a Huntsman Araldite\u00ae epoxy, NanoTek\u00ae aluminum oxide nanoparticles (45nm, determined from specific surface area, Nanophase Technologies Corporation), and silane coupling agent (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), Gelest Inc.). The nanoparticle size distribution was examined by TEM (not shown here), with the range from 20 to 200nm.

Specimens were molded from silicone rubber and polished before using. The fracture toughness of the materials was determined by means of CT tests on at least four specimens according to ASTM Standard E1820 and ASTM Standard D5045. CT specimens were tested under displacement control on an Instron 4204 machine, using pin loading and a low deformation speed of 0.1mm/min. At least 4 samples were tested for each condition. The thickness B and the width W of specimens were chosen to be 12.7 and 25.4mm, respectively. Prior to testing, a notch was molded and then sharpened by tapping a fresh razor blade in to the material, so that a sharp crack was initiated with a length <i>a</i>\n                        0 between 0.45 and 0.55W.

The value of the Paris law exponent <i>n</i> drops from 10 for the pure epoxy to 7 for 10phr (3.1 vol.%) NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, and further to 5 for 10phr (3.1 vol.%) APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.

All crack propagation is from left to right. The structure at the left end of each material is from the pre-crack made by a fresh razor blade.

With increasing magnification, however, more river lines, debonding, plastic void growth and particle pull-out mechanisms can be seen ([fig6](c) and (d)). We observed these mechanisms for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites in a low crack-propagation-speed tensile test [bib1], but not for the high crack-propagation-speed fracture toughness test. In the present low frequency fatigue test, the applied stress intensity range is only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the <i>K</i>\n                        Ic value, and the crack propagation rate is much lower than in the fracture toughness test.

More river lines, debonding and plastic void growth, and particle pull-out mechanisms can also be seen here. In addition, some new features are presented. Unique 3D plastic deformation of the matrix around the nanoparticles can be clearly observed. The well-bonded APTES-Al2O3 nanoparticles or small aggregates of few nanoparticles act as pinning positions and induce plastic deformation of the matrix during the low crack-propagation-rate fatigue test. This mechanism makes it possible to further retard the fatigue crack growth rate of the epoxy matrix."]]]], ["Discussion", ["The possible fracture and fatigue mechanisms, including crack deflection [bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19], crack pinning [bib20 bib21 bib22], debonding [bib23] and plastic void growth [bib4 bib13], and plastic deformation of the matrix are discussed in the following section.", ["Crack deflection", ["An increase in fracture surface roughness can be used as evidence to prove crack deflection occurs, which is associated with an increase in the crack length and therefore the energy absorbed during deformation [bib32 bib33]. However the fracture surface roughness of both NT-Al2O3 and APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites did not change significantly compared with the neat polymer (not shown here). In addition, the fracture surface roughness values of all materials from the <i>K</i>\n                        Ic fracture toughness test are much smaller compared to that from the tensile test (Fig. 8 in [bib1]). This result implies that crack deflection is more prevalent in the tensile test environment than in the pre-cracked fracture toughness test. This is because in the fracture toughness test, a sharp pre-crack with crack length <i>a</i>\n                        0 has been produced by a fresh razor blade before testing, which gives a much higher stress intensity value <i>K</i> at the crack tip than in the nominally defect free tensile test at the same applied stress condition. During the pre-cracked fracture toughness test, the <i>K</i> value reaches the <i>K</i>\n                        Ic value very fast and the stored energy is dissipated by high-speed unstable crack growth and leaves a smooth fracture surface [bib36]. On the contrary, in the tensile test, the crack grows very slowly after initiation; then cracks accelerate and any excess energy is dissipated by driving the crack faster (the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone); outside the mirror zone, the crack reaches its limiting speed, and excess stored energy is dissipated in bifurcation and leaves a rough 3D fracture surface (the \u2018rough\u2019 zone) [bib36].", "Work by Arakawa and Takahashi [bib37], as reported by Hull [bib32 bib33], showed that the toughening effect due to an increase in true fracture surface area from crack deflection gives a linear relationship between the surface roughness and the fracture energy. However no such correlation exists for these nanocomposites ([fig8]\n                        ). Fracture energy was the highest at 10\u201315phr for both the NT-Al2O3 and the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, but the roughness increased linearly with loading. This result indicates that the small increases of surface roughness for the nanocomposites may not be due to the crack deflection. In addition, the plot of surface roughness vs. fracture toughness is shifted to the right for the APTES-Al2O3/EP compared to the NT-Al2O3 implying that while surface roughness may play a part, it is not a primary mechanism.", "In addition to surface roughness, Faber and Evans\u2019 crack deflection theory [bib16 bib17] can be used to predict the increases in fracture energy <i>G</i>\n                        Ic. However, Evans\u2019 theory states that crack deflection will occur when the obstacle dimension is larger than the plastic zone, which is not the case in the present work. This and the surface roughness results discussed above indicate that crack deflection is not the main toughening mechanism."]], ["Crack pinning", ["According to crack pinning theory by Evans [bib21] and by Green et al.

As discussed above, on the <i>K</i>\n                        Ic test fracture surfaces of the NT-Al2O3/epoxy and the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, there is no difference in the degree of crack deflection; there is less evidence of debonding or plastic void growth; therefore plastic deformation of the matrix, due to the surface modification of the nanoparticles in the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite, might be one explanation for the extra increment in its fracture energy ([fig8])."]]]], ["Conclusions", ["The fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth rate of well-dispersed Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites were measured as a function of nanoparticle loading and particle/matrix compatibility.
