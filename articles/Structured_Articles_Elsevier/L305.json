{"title": "Dynamic mechanical analysis of polyvinylalcohol/silica nanocomposite", "abstract": "Polyvinylalcohol/Silica (PVA/SiO2) nanocomposites with different SiO2 contents are synthesized by employing a novel self-assembly monolayer (SAM) technique. The influence of the silica on dynamic mechanical properties of the nanocomposites is investigated by conducting dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and quasi-thermal mechanical analysis (Q-TMA). It is found that the storage modulus (<i>E</i>\u2032), loss factor (<i>tga</i>), glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     g), and activation energy (<i>E</i>\n                     a) of prepared nanocomposites all show a strong dependence on the SiO2 content. The Q-TMA results indicate that under a constant force, the elasticity of nanocomposites decreases with SiO2 content, and the softening temperature moves to a higher temperature when more SiO2 is added.", "body": [], "doi": "10.1016/j.synthmet.2005.07.098"}
