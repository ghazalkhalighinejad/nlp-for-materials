Organic/inorganic composite materials combine the advantages of the inorganic materials such as rigidity, hardness, durability, thermal stability and those of the organic polymers (flexibility and processability). Due to the unique properties, these types of materials have attracted strong interest in many industrial processes [bib0015]. The potential applications of polymer nanocomposites are coatings, flame retardant materials, optical devices, electronical and optical packaging materials, etc. [bib0020 bib0025 bib0030]. A lot of works deals with various types of nanosized fillers and various methods of polymer/nanocomposites technology [bib0035 bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055]. Among the numerous organic/inorganic nanocomposites the preparation, characterization, properties and applications of polystyrene/silica systems have been reported as a great area of active research [bib0005 bib0060]. The dispersion of nanometer-sized particles in the polymer matrix has a significant impact on the properties of nanocomposites. A variety of methods have been used to enhance the compatibility between the hydrophobic polystyrene and silica. The most frequently used method is to modify the surface of silica nanoparticles either by chemical or physical methods. The extremely large surface area and smooth nonporous surface of silica nanoparticles can intensify the effect of particle\u2013particle and/or polymer\u2013particle interactions, which could promote strong physical contact between the silica and the polystyrene [bib0065 bib0070]. The loading of inorganic particles within polymers is usually performed by a wide range of methods, but unfortunately the simple mixing of organic and inorganic components at the macroscopic level is energy consuming and usually not very successful [bib0005]. Thermal stability is considered as an important factor from the scientific and industrial point of view, playing role in the nanocomposite structure and morphology formation [bib0075]. A better understanding of polymer degradation gives valuable data on the period of the applicability time of the material [bib0080]. It has been shown that the thermal behavior of polymer nanocomposites depends on the nanofiller type and content [bib0085 bib0090]. One of the properties of a polymer, which can be profoundly affected by nanoparticles, is the glass transition temperature <i>T</i>\n                     g. It has been reported that polymers <i>T</i>\n                     g can be changed by the addition of nanofiller [bib0095 bib0100]. The temperature range of the availability of hybrid materials depends, among others, on their glass transition temperature. Therefore, it is of a great importance to develop a method to predict the <i>T</i>\n                     g of a new material [bib0105 bib0110]. In this paper a simple method for nanocomposite preparation in solution [bib0115] was applied to prepare a series of polystyrene/silica nanocomposite materials. In order to improve nanocomposite homogeneity, silica with chemically modified surface was dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. The aim of the work was to study the influence of different silica content on thermal properties of polystyrene hybrid materials prepared in the form of film. The correlation between glass transition temperature of polystyrene nanocomposites and filler content was described by fitted hyperbolic equation. The additional goal was to determine the optimum silica content for the enhancement of the nanocomposites thermal stability."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials", ["Polystyrene (PS), under the commercial name STYRON 678E, obtained from Dow Chemicals, USA, with molecular weight of 240,000, polydispersity index (M\n                           <i>w</i>\n                        /M\n                           <i>n</i>\n                        ) of 2.5, density of 1.05g/cm3 (ISO 1183) and melt mass flow index of 11 (g/10min) was used as a polymer matrix.

For silica content of 30wt.% the material exhibits a significant number of agglomerates with an average particle size of about 120nm, which might lead to deterioration of nanocomposite thermal stability. These results are in agreement with the fact that available nanoparticles are generally in the form of agglomerates and it is rather hard to be dispersed in their original dimensions, due to the strong interaction among them [bib0010].

The influence of the nanoparticles in polymer composites on <i>T</i>\n                        g is controversial since <i>T</i>\n                        g of nanocomposites depends on a variety of factors such as degree of polymerization, polymer chemical structure, filler size, filler loading, dispersion conditions, etc. [bib0135].
