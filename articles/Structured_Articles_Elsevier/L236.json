{"title": "PBAT based nanocomposites for medical and industrial applications", "abstract": "Poly(butylene adipate-<i>co-</i>terephthalate) (PBAT) based nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending PBAT with 5 and 10wt.% of clay nanoparticles (unmodified and modified montmorillonites, unmodified and modified fluoro-hectorites, and unmodified sepiolites). All nanocomposites showed a good level of clay distribution and dispersion into PBAT, especially nanocomposites with high clay chemical affinity with the polymer matrix. DSC results showed that addition of layered silicates slightly hindered kinetics and extent of crystallization of PBAT; however, sepiolite particles were able to promote polymer crystallization kinetics and the transformation of the PBAT crystal structure to a more ordered form.\n                  Similar increases in the thermal stability of PBAT in nitrogen and air were obtained upon addition of all clays, due to a barrier effect of the clays toward polymer decomposition product ablation.\n                  Preliminary biocompatibility tests indicated that PBAT based materials with 10% clay content have good biological safety and display almost no cytotoxicity.\n                  The addition of all nanofillers increased the hardness of PBAT matrix. The DMA analysis showed that all nanocomposites presented higher E\u2032 values than neat PBAT, indicating that addition of clays improved the mechanical properties of PBAT. For layered silicate nanocomposites, the main influencing factors on the thermo-mechanical properties appeared to be the aspect ratio and dispersion of clay nanoplatelets, rather than polymer/clay chemical affinity. The highest E\u2032 values of sepiolite based nanocomposites make this nanoparticle the most attractive material for tissue engineering and environmental industrial applications.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Tissue engineering (TE) is a multidisciplinary field focused on the development and application of knowledge in chemistry, physics, engineering, life and clinical sciences to the solution of medical problems, as tissue loss and organ failure. It involves the fundamental understanding of structure and function relationships in normal and pathological tissues and the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function.", "Different efforts have been addressed to develop a generation of biomaterials with the ability to interact with the biological environment, to enhance the biological response and the tissue/surface bonding, as well as by the development of bio-absorbable materials with the ability to undergo a progressive degradation while new tissue regenerates and heals [bb0005]. Biodegradable polymers of synthetic and natural origin such as polyglycolide (PGA), polylactide (PLA), polydioxanone (PDS), poly(3-caprolactone) (PCL), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyorthoester, chitosan, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (PHEMA), hyaluronic acid and other hydrogels have been extensively studied and used in many tissue engineering applications, such as bone substitution, repair of bone fractures, cartilage, meniscus and intervertebral disc [bb0010]. In particular, synthetic biodegradable polymers have attracted special attention because they enable a better control of their physico-chemical properties and also because they have been successfully used in clinical applications.", "Some of these biodegradable polymers have also received much attention due to their potential impact upon the complex issue of plastic waste management. Aliphatic polyesters are one of the most promising structural materials for biodegradable or compostable films, sheets, bottles and injection-molded products. However, commercial utility of high molecular weight aliphatic polyesters has been limited to polyesters produced by microorganisms, ring-opening polymerization of lactones and ring-opening poly-addition of cyclic dimmers, because of high production costs and their inherent unfavorable physical and mechanical properties\u00a0[bb0015]. Compared to aliphatic polyesters, aromatic polyesters are materials which display an excellent pattern of physical properties: they are strongly resistant to hydrolysis, as well as to bacterial and fungal attack and they usually remain unaltered in the environment. Therefore, the combination of aliphatic and aromatic units in the same polyester chain has been envisaged for a long time as an attractive approach to obtain novel products encompassing biodegradability and high performance properties\u00a0[bb0015]. For instance, new copolyesters of poly(butylene adipate-<i>co</i>-terephthalate) (PBAT) mainly derived from 1,4-butanediol, adipic acid and terephthalic acid with tunable balance between the biodegradation and desirable physical properties\u00a0[bb0020 bb0025] have been commercialized under the trademarks of Ecoflex and Easter-bio by BASF and Eastman Chemical, respectively [bb0030]. Moreover, PBAT is flexible and has a higher elongation at break than most biodegradable polyesters, such as polylactic acid (PLA), being therefore more suitable for packaging films [bb0035]. Despite of the good background for industrial applications of PBAT, this polymer has been very scarcely studied for medical devices, only very few articles report the possibility of its use for clinical applications after the surface immobilization of chitosan, heparin and hialuronic acid [bb0040].", "The main limitations toward wider industrial and medical applications of PBAT are its poor thermal and mechanical resistance that limits its access to some sectors such as packaging or bone implants. Nevertheless, the above drawbacks could be overcome by enhancing thermal and/or mechanical properties through filling techniques. Indeed, it has been found that addition of nano-sized fillers is able to potentially confer multifunctional enabling properties to several polymers (enhanced magnetic, catalytic, optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties when compared to conventional formulations of the same material) [bb0045 bb0050 bb0055 bb0060 bb0065]. Moreover, in recent years, researchers have expressed an increased interest in exploring numerous biomedical applications of nanomaterials [bb0050 bb0055], finding that nanotechnology can provide an alternative platform with higher mechanical strength, enhanced bioactivity and resorbability in improving the quality of life of patients who suffer from debilitating bone fractures [bb0070].", "Concerning to industrial applications, among the various nanoparticles nanoclays (layered silicates) have been the most studied [bb0075 bb0080 bb0085]. Currently, the preferred layered materials are phyllosilicate clays of the 2:1 type, and in particular montmorillonite (MMT) and hectorite (HT). These layered silicates in the unmodified form usually contain Na+ or K+ ions [bb0090], and they are only miscible with hydrophilic polymers [bb0065 bb0095], thus, to increase compatibility with other kinds of polymer matrices, it is necessary to convert the normally hydrophilic silicate interlayer environment into an organophilic one, making possible the interactions with the polymer chains. The preparation of organophilic clays was achieved by ion-exchange reactions with cationic surfactants including primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary alkylammonium or alkylphosphonium cations [bb0085]; the obtained modified layered silicate clays are of particular interest due to their contribute to significant enhancements of a large number of polymer physical properties (gas barrier, flame resistance, thermal stability, <i>etc.</i>) as compared to unmodified layered silicate clays [bb0085 bb0100].", "Concerning to PBAT based nanocomposites, only few articles report studies of PBAT/clay nano-biocomposites. Someya et al. [bb0105 bb0110] investigated the morphology and the properties of PBAT/clay nanocomposites prepared by melt intercalation, containing 3\u201310wt.% organically modified montmorillonites (OMMT), obtaining certain level of clay intercalation and exfoliation in some compositions. Chivrac et al. [bb0115 bb0120] have also tested various montmorillonites (MMT) in PBAT compositions by different preparation processes (<i>i.e.</i>, solvent or melt intercalation), revealing that higher intercalation degrees were obtained by solvent intercalation and the stiffness of PBAT matrix increased continuously with clay content due to the existence of strong interactions between PBAT and nanofillers. No studies on PBAT and PBAT clay based nanocomposites have been carried out for their possible use as biomedical materials.", "Sepiolite particles are layered hydrated magnesium silicates characterized by a needle like morphology based on alternated blocks of tunnels in the fiber direction and very high surface area (BET 374\u00b17m2/g) comparing to most of layered phyllosilicates (BET 82\u00b11m2/g). These clays have a structure constituted by a magnesium octahedral sheet in-between 2 layers of silica tetrahedrons, which extend as a continuous layer with an inversion of the apical ends every six units [bb0125]. Micronization increases disagglomeration of the bundles of microfibers, enhancing interactions between the nanoparticles and the polymer; however, in spite of their possible high improvements in polymer physical properties, very few works report the use of sepiolites as additive in polymer matrices [bb0130]. Even more, to the best of our knowledge, so far there are no reports on the interactions of these nanoparticles with PBAT.", "The aim of this work is to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of PBAT, making materials potentially interesting for tissue engineering and environmental industrial applications by adding different types of nanoparticles, such as montmorillonites, hectorites and sepiolites, into a PBAT matrix."]], ["Materials and methods", ["Poly(butylene adipate-<i>co</i>-terephthalate) (PBAT) (see [f0010]\n                     ) \u2013 Ecoflex\u2122 \u2013 with 44mol% BT and Mw\n                     =140kDa, was supplied by BASF, Germany.", "Different types of nanoparticles were used in this work: modified and unmodified montmorillonites, modified and unmodified fluoro-hectorites, and an unmodified sepiolite.

The apparently higher dispersion level (exfoliation) observed upon addition of 5% CLO30B as compared to that obtained for 10% CLO30B based nanocomposites could be related to a lower exfoliation level of silicate layers above 5wt.% of filling content, because of geometrical constraints within the limited space remaining available in the polyester matrix [bb0140].", "In the case of NAN based materials ([f0020]a), a slight shift of the clay diffraction peak to lower angles is observed, corresponding to an increase of the interlayer distance of around 0.1nm for both nanocomposites, and indicating the obtainment of certain intercalation level in these nanocomposites without organo-modifying the nanofiller.

These superior improvements in E\u2032 obtained for SEP based nanocomposites can be associated to the characteristic needle-like shape of sepiolite particles, as fibrous fillers are reported to be more easily dispersible than platelets-like fillers [bb0170]. In this way, the relative small contact surface of fibrous fillers and hence their reduced tendency to agglomerate could lead to better interactions with the polymer matrix [bb0170].", "The increases in E\u2032 obtained for all nanocomposites are even more evident at high temperature, a fact that can be attributed to restricted polymer chain motions above Tg due to the presence of the nanoparticles [bb0160], leading to increases of E\u2032 by <i>ca.</i> 300\u2013550% for nanocomposites based on 5% clay content at 80\u00b0C (see [f0100]\n                            and [t0020]). Indeed, considerable increases in the temperature of the Tan Delta maximum are found upon addition of 5% of all clays into the PBAT matrix (see [t0020] and [f0080]b) and related to higher restricted movements of PBAT polymer chains by the presence of nanoparticles.", "As compared to 5% clay content based nanocomposites, the addition of 10% of clays brings, for almost all nanocomposites, further increases of E\u2032 below Tg,, obtaining increases of about 130% for PBAT/NAN, 170\u2013190% for PBAT/CLO30B, 130% for PBAT/SOMM100, 160\u2013170% for PBAT/SOMMEE and 240% for PBAT/SEP at 20\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C ([t0020], see [f0085 f0090 f0095]).

Simultaneously, SOMMEE based nanocomposites present higher improvements in the elastic properties of PBAT matrix than SOMM100 based materials.
