The mechanisms leading to this improvement, however, are incompletely understood. In this paper, a model system of nanoscale alumina filled bisphenol A based epoxy with two interface conditions was used to highlight the mechanisms leading to significant improvements in both ductility (max 39%) and modulus (max 18%). Tensile test showed that crack deflection, debonding and plastic deformation of the debonded matrix (plastic void growth) operated for the untreated particles with a relatively weak interface, but that a stronger interface led to enhanced crack deflection and microcracking, and, as a result, a further improvement in properties.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Bisphenol A based epoxides are used in applications ranging from electric insulators to adhesives to composite resins [bib5 bib6 bib7]. Like other thermosetting materials, however, they are brittle. Therefore, micron-sized fillers have been added to epoxy resin to form composites with a better combination of mechanical, thermal and electrical properties [bib8]. Toughening epoxy by soft particles, such as rubber, is widely used [bib9 bib10 bib11], but reduces the stiffness of the epoxy. Rigid particles have also been used to improve the stiffness of epoxy. The limitation of such fillers is that they cause a decrease in ductility and opacity [bib12]. Recently, nanoscale fillers have been used to try to overcome these limitations [bib13]. The small particle size leads to smaller defects and increases particle/matrix interfacial area which provides and opportunity to tailor composite properties, even at a rather low filler loading [bib14 bib15 bib16]. Ash et al. [bib1] report that at an optimum weight fraction, the nanosized alumina filled PMMA composites display a room-temperature brittle-to-ductile transition in uniaxial tension with an increase in the strain-to-failure that averages 40% strain. Kinloch et al. [bib2 bib3 bib4] observed a doubling of the fracture toughness in nanosilica filled epoxy nanocomposites.", "There are a set of models that address mechanisms leading to enhanced ductility when either rubber particles or rigid particles are used as fillers, including crack deflection theory by Faber and Evans [bib17 bib18], and by Spanoudakis and Young [bib19 bib20]; crack pinning theory by Lange [bib21], Evans [bib22], and Green et al. [bib23]; debonding theory by Evans et al. [bib24]; plastic void growth theory by Huang and Kinloch [bib11 bib4]; and particle pull-out and microcracking. This paper attempts to clarify the mechanisms operating in nanofilled epoxy; and in the discussion section, a quantitative comparison of our results with the theories suggests that the operative mechanisms are interface dependent.", ["Crack deflection", ["Crack deflection causes an increase in the total fracture surface area and therefore absorbs more energy compared to unfilled polymer materials. This increase in area can be evaluated by measuring the fracture surface roughness [bib27]. Crack deflection also causes the crack to grow locally under mixed-mode I/II or I/III conditions, the impact of which of toughness can be evaluated by Faber and Evans\u2019s crack deflection theory [bib17 bib18]. A lower bound toughness increment is believed to result from the increase in surface area according to [bib17]\n                        \n                           \n

The calculation was based on the assumption that the APTES silane hydrolyzed completely and the difference in weight loss at 900\u00b0C between the APTES\u2013Al2O3 and the NT-Al2O3 nanoparticles was due to the loss of hydrocarbon components of the silane.

The agreement between the prediction and the experimental data is reasonable. The measured moduli of the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites generally lie slightly below the predicted relationship. This is commonly observed because the model assumes that the particle/matrix interface is perfectly bonded. Although the interface adhesion condition is improved by surface modified Al2O3 nanoparticles with APTES silane, it was still not perfect ([fig1]c and d). However, the measured moduli of the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are slightly above the predicted line. This result can be considered further using the Lewis\u2013Nielsen model [bib36] and the work of McGee and McCullough [bib37].", "The Lewis\u2013Nielsen predictions for non-agglomerated spheres with two different interface conditions (with slippage and no slippage) bracket the experimental data of APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites ([fig3]a and b), which indicates that there is likely to be imperfect adhesion between the particles and matrix. This result corresponds to the predictions from Halpin\u2013Tsai model. At the same time, the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite shows lower modulus than the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite over the whole range of filler loading. This phenomenon was also observed by Wu et al. [bib38] for the surface modified SiO2 filled polypropylene. It is well known that a stronger interface can lead to a higher modulus, as predicted by Lewis\u2013Nielsen model. However, in this case, the soft layer of the APTES may be reducing the reinforcing effect of the nanoparticles. In addition, the moduli of NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are even higher than the Lewis\u2013Nielsen prediction for non-agglomerated spheres with a perfect interface ([fig3]b). Nielsen and Landel [bib8] noted that the agglomeration and structuring decreases the maximum packing value <i>\u03d5</i>\n                        max, and therefore, increases the modulus of the composite.

The high magnification SEM images show that the fracture surfaces of the 10phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig5]c) and the 10phr APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig5]f) are quite similar inside the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone. Particle pull-out (toughening mechanism A in [fig5]), debonding between nanoparticles and matrix and plastic void growth (indicated by the voids around the nanoparticles, toughening mechanism B in [fig5]) can be clearly seen in both materials. Particle pull-out, which leaves hemispherical holes on the fracture surface, is due to the debonding of the nanoparticles and therefore, will not be considered as an independent mechanism. As discussed previously ([fig1]d), stronger nanoparticle/epoxy adhesion is found in the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites before the tensile test; however, this stronger interface debonded here. In addition, voids formed around both NT-Al2O3 and APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanoparticles. Johnsen et al. [bib4] reported that plastic void growth was the main toughening mechanism for nanosilica particles filled epoxy composites with weak interface between the nanoparticles and the matrix. In the present work, plastic void growth (toughening mechanism B) exists in both NT-Al2O3 and APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanocomposites. By carefully examining the SEM images, it was found that voids deform more for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites ([fig5]f and g) than that for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites ([fig5]c and d). For the sake of simplicity, the voids are assumed to be spherical. The average void to particle size ratio <i>d</i>\n                        v/<i>d</i>\n                        f, measured from the SEM images was 1.1 for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites and 1.3 for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.", "[fig6]\n                        a\u2013e shows the enlarged SEM images in the \u2018hackle\u2019 zones for the neat polymer, 10phr NT-Al2O3 and 10phr APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites. Large hackle markings can be seen in the neat polymer ([fig6]a). However, the fracture morphologies of NT-Al2O3 and APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanocomposites are quite different from the neat polymer. The much rougher fracture surfaces with 3D fine hackle markings appear in the nanocomposites ([fig6]b and d). The high magnification SEM images show that the fracture surfaces of the 10 phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig6]c) and the 10phr APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig6]e) are different inside the \u2018hackle\u2019 zone. In the poorly-bonded NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite, the particles can be seen clearly and the crack seems to have propagated around their equator. The fracture surface, therefore, consists of hemispherical holes and the top surface of debonded particles (morphology A and B in [fig6]c); however, in the well-bonded APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite, the particles are not as distinct and the epoxy resin matrix covers the particles (morphology C in [fig6]e), which indicates that the crack may propagate through the matrix above or below the poles of the particles. The interfacial debonding observed in the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone of APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanocomposite was not seen in \u2018hackle\u2019 zone.", "Transmission electron micrographs perpendicular to the tensile fracture surface (denoted by FS in the figures) in the \u2018hackle\u2019 zone of 10phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy and 10phr APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are shown in [fig7]\n                        . Microcracking and debonding away from the crack is not observed in the 10phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig7]a). However, small wave-like structures are observed near the fracture surface of the 10phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite, indicating microcracking ([fig7]b)."]]]], ["Discussion", ["It is clear from the results that the silane treated APTES\u2013Al2O3 particle filled nanocomposites showed significant increases in strain-to-break (39% at 10phr filler loading) while exhibiting an increase in modulus and maintained strength in tensile tests. Many authors have also observed that addition of particles to a brittle material increase the toughness [bib3 bib4 bib41]. In this study, tensile toughness of the nanocomposite will be characterized by the area under stress\u2013strain curve, <i>W</i> \n                     [bib42 bib43]; therefore, the fracture toughness increment <i>G</i>\n                     Ic/<i>G</i>\n                     Ic,m used in the theoretical models in the introduction will be replaced by <i>W</i>\n                     c\n                     <i>/W</i>\n                     m, where <i>W</i>\n                     c is the tensile toughness of the composite and <i>W</i>\n                     m is that of the epoxy matrix. The possible toughening contributions will be discussed in detail, and predicted by analytical models in the following section.", ["Crack deflection", ["As mentioned in the introduction, increasing fracture surface roughness can be used as evidence to prove crack deflection is occurring, which increases the crack length and therefore, the energy absorbed during deformation [bib27]. The roughness in the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone was too small, therefore, only the surface roughness in the \u2018hackle\u2019 zone as a function of nanoparticle concentration (phr) are presented in [fig8]\n                        . The fracture surface roughness of NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites increases with the filler loading (maximum 1400nm), which indicates increasing crack deflection and crack length. All of the fracture surface roughness values of APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are higher than both neat polymer and NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites at the same particle loading (except for 20phr), which indicates more crack deflection for the treated nanocomposites. Spanoudakis and Young\u2019s argument [bib20] suggest that for poorly-bonded NT-Al2O3 particles, the maximum tensile stress is at the equators of the particles, which means the cracks propagating through the composite are attracted to the equator of the particles and then merge into the debonded particle/matrix interface ([fig6]f). The fracture surface, therefore, consists of hemispherical holes and the top surface of debonded particles (morphology A and B in [fig6]c), and the fracture surface roughness is low. For the well-bonded APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite, the maximum stress is in the matrix above and below the poles of the particle [bib20], which means the cracks are attracted to the matrix near the poles of the particles ([fig6]g), and therefore, the fracture surface roughness increases. The SEM morphology supports this (morphology C in [fig6]e), because in the APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanoparticles there is a layer of epoxy resin covering the particles. It is clear that crack deflection occurred in both nanocomposites; however, the crack deflected more in the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.", "The measured tensile toughness (area under stress\u2013strain curve) may also be compared to Faber and Evans\u2019 crack deflection theory [bib17 bib18].

Curve (a) represents the lower bound increment from surface area increase; (b) and (c) are the increment contributed from the crack tilt and twist, where (b) assumes a uniform spacing of particles \u2013 perfect dispersion, and (c) assumes a distributed spacing of particles. The agreement between experimental data and the predictions is reasonable only at low volume fraction (no significant <i>T</i>\n                        g change range) for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites. The discrepancy between the experimental data and the predictions for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites indicates that there is a competing mechanism, probably agglomeration, which decreases the tensile toughness.", "In addition, the correlation between the fracture surface roughness and the area under stress\u2013strain curve (tensile toughness) for both nanocomposites compared with the neat polymer are presented in [fig10]\n                        . For APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, except for 20phr samples, a linear correlation line can be drawn, indicating an increase in toughness due to crack deflection; however, there is no clear relationship between roughness and tensile toughness for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites."]], ["Crack pinning", ["A comparison of the predicted <i>\u03c3</i>\n                        c/<i>\u03c3</i>\n                        m ratio by Evan\u2019s and Green\u2019s theories and the experimental <i>\u03c3</i>\n                        c/<i>\u03c3</i>\n                        m ratio calculated from the ratio of tensile toughness, represented by the area under stress\u2013strain curve <i>W</i>\n                        c/<i>W</i>\n                        m did not correlate. Johnsen et al. [bib4] argued that crack pinning occurred when the particles were larger than the crack-opening displacement, which is 1.7\u03bcm for neat epoxy matrix. Therefore, nanoparticles are unlikely to cause crack pinning."]], ["Debonding and plastic void growth", ["As discussed in Section [sec1], an idealized debonding law was proposed by Evans et al. [bib24]. However, this theory is difficult to use for tensile test results, because the size of the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip can not be directly calculated. The fracture morphology might be the only evidence. Debonding between well-bonded APTES\u2013Al2O3 nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix, which depends on the crack propagation speed [bib40], is observed in the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone on the fracture surface of the nanocomposite ([fig5]f and g); however, poorly-bonded NT-Al2O3 nanoparticles debonded everywhere through the whole sample (Figs. [fig5]c & d and [fig6]c). Therefore, the increments due to the interfacial debonding for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy and NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite are very difficult to compare, which indicates that debonding is important but not the main mechanism that distinguishes the two nanocomposites with different interface conditions.", "Johnsen et al. [bib4] proved in their work, using the Huang and Kinloch theory, that plastic void growth could be the main toughening mechanism in SiO2 nanoparticle filled epoxy nanocomposites. In the present work, plastic void growth was observed in the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone of both the NT-Al2O3/epoxy and the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites ([fig5]c, d, f and g) and in the \u2018hackle\u2019 zone of the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite ([fig6]c), indicating it could be another toughening mechanism. The Huang and Kinloch model [bib11] can be used to confirm whether the plastic void growth could be responsible for the toughening effect. The average void to particle size ratio <i>d</i>\n                        v/<i>d</i>\n                        f, measured from the SEM images ([fig5]c and f), was 1.1 for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy and 1.3 for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy. Therefore, <i>d</i>\n                        v/<i>V</i>\n                        f and <i>V</i>\n                        v/<i>V</i>\n                        f\n                        =1.33 were used in the prediction for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy and the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy, respectively. In addition, plastic void growth was only observed in the \u2018mirror\u2019 zone of the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites ([fig5]f and g), which was about 20% of the whole fracture surface area ([fig4]c). For the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, plastic void growth can be seen across the whole fracture surfaces (Figs. [fig5]c & d and [fig7]c); therefore, it was assumed that all of the particles initiate the growth of voids. [fig11]\n                         shows the experimental data (points) and theoretical predictions (line (a) and (b)) from Huang and Kinloch\u2019s theory of strain\u2013energy density, characterized by the area under stress\u2013strain curve, <i>W</i> \n                        [bib25 bib26], as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction for NT-Al2O3 and APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites. The agreements between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction fit well for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, but are low for the APTES\u2013-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, indicating that plastic void growth may be the main mechanism for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites. However, the higher values of the data points for the APTES\u2013Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites indicate the existence of other mechanisms."]], ["Particle pull-out and microcracking", ["Other minor toughening mechanisms such as particle pull-out and microcracking can be observed by SEM or TEM.
