In situ X-ray scattering during deformation indicated that these mechanical enhancements arise not only from the CNTs, but also from their impact on soft-segment crystallization. The deformation behavior after yielding of the nanocomposites, irrespective of CNT concentration, is similar to the unfilled elastomer, implying that the mechanistics of large deformation is mainly governed by the matrix. The relative enhancement of the Young's modulus of the nanocomposites is comparable to other elastomeric nanocomposites, implying that to the first order specific chemical details of the elastomeric system is unimportant.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Elastomers with high electrical conductivity are critical for applications ranging from seals between pipes used for transferring flammable gases, electrostatic automotive painting and electromagnetic shielding for mobile electronics. Traditionally, conductive fillers, such as carbon black, chopped carbon fiber or metallic flakes are used. Conductivity is established by percolative network formation of the fillers and limited by carrier transport (hopping or tunneling) between filler particles. Thus the extent of filler dispersion, aspect ratio of the filler, and wettability of the filler by the elastomeric medium are key morphological characteristics in determining the conductivity of the system. The relatively large volume fractions (>20vol%) necessary though, negatively impact deformability, processibility, surface finish, and limit the ability to maintain desired conductivity at extreme deformations (>100%). Furthermore, the use of metallic fillers results in galvanic corrosion issues in many service environments.", "The broad availability of nanoscale multiwall carbon nanotubes with large aspect ratios (>100) and high electrical conductivity (<i>\u03c3</i>\u223c18,000S/cm along tube axis) have lead to a resurgence of applied and fundamental investigations of filled polymers, driven by the potential to address limitations of classic conductive fillers. Whether tubes (e.g. single and multiwall carbon nanotubes) or plates (e.g. exfoliated graphite), the nanoscopic dimensions and high aspect ratios inherent in these <i>polymer nanocomposites</i> result in six interrelated characteristics distinguishing them from classic fillers: (1) low percolation threshold (\u223c0.1\u20132vol%); (2) particle-particle correlation (orientation and position) arising at low volume fractions (<i>\u03d5</i>\n                     C<10\u22123); (3) large number density of particles per particle volume (106\u2013108 particles/\u03bcm3); (4) extensive interfacial area per volume of particles (103\u2013104\n                     m2/ml); (5) short interparticle spacing (10\u201350nm at <i>\u03d5</i>\u223c1\u20138vol%); and (6) comparable size scales between the rigid nanoparticle inclusion, distance between particles, and the relaxation volume of the polymer matrix. These characteristics provide materials with properties of traditional filled systems, but at lower loadings and thus enhanced processibility. Additionally, novel properties absent in traditional filled systems are reported. Recent reviews of materials fabrication and fundamental structure-property correlations can be found in the literature [bib1]. Much of the current effort in polymer nanocomposites though is plagued by uncertainties as to what is possible, necessitating substantially more detailed structure-processing-property investigations.", "Carbon nanotube filled plastics are currently under intensive investigation for enhancement of structural [bib2 bib3], stress-recovery [bib4], electrical [bib5 bib6] and thermal performance [bib7 bib8], while maintaining the inherent processibility and deformability of the matrix resin. Optimization of electrical characteristics presents an interesting dilemma. Maximum dispersion of the nanotubes is desired to provide the lowest percolation threshold; however, this necessitates favorable polymer\u2013tube interactions, which will result in a strongly bound polymer interfacial layer. Conversely, this will establish a minimum tube\u2013tube distance, which ultimately determines electrical conductivity by limiting carrier transport and creating capacitive contacts between tubes. In addition, for conductive elastomers maximization of deformability implies minimizing the strength of tube\u2013polymer interactions. One possibility to address these conflicting requirements is to utilize a nanotube with a heterogeneous surface, which spatially segregates strong tube\u2013tube interactions favoring aggregation from maximum tube\u2013polymer interactions favoring dispersion.", "Following these suppositions, aspects of the deformation-morphology correlation of an electrically conductive, elastomeric nanocomposite are presented. Uniaxial elongation in combination with in situ X-ray studies indicate that nanotube orientation and polymer deformation are coupled, altering the strain induced soft-segment crystallinity and the mechanical response of the polyurethane at increasing strain. The complex interrelation implies that the extensive characterization discussed herein is necessary, but still not sufficient to effectively establish deformation-morphology relationships for nanotube containing elastomers."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials and specimen preparation", ["The fabrication of the carbon nanotubes (CNT)\u2014elastomer nanocomposite (CNT/PU) is discussed elsewhere [bib4]. In brief, after short, light grinding of the carbon nanotubes (PRT-HT-19, Applied Science Inc.) with a mortar and pestle, they are combined with a small amount of polymer (Morthane PS455-203, Huntsman Polyurethanes, aromatic polyester based thermoplastic polyurethane) in a polar medium, such as THF, for several hours [bib9]. The composition of Morthane was evaluated by quantitative 13C and 1H NMR. The peaks were assigned in the proton spectra using 2D NMR methods (COSY and TOCSY) and in the carbon spectrum using DEPT [bib10].

The quantitative analysis shows that the Morthane contains only 10% hard-segments and almost exclusively linear diols with no more than 5% cyclic diols.", "This mixture is then added to a polymer solution in the same solvent, stirred for an additional 2\u20134h, and transferred into casting molds to allow slow solvent evaporation. The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0C until a constant weight was achieved. Nanotube\u2013elastomer nanocomposites may be produced in this manner whose lateral size approaches several feet, with thickness from 0.5 to 2mm, and volume fractions of nanotubes from 0.05 to 15% (density of CNT \u223c2.1gcm\u22123, Morthane \u223c1.19gcm\u22123).

The conductivity scale factor <i>\u03c3</i>\n                        0 reflects the resistive nature of charge transfer between tubes in the blend, yielding a conductivity substantially less than determined for a pure CNT (18kS/cm, measured by ASI on a single fiber) [bib14]. The low volume fraction at percolation is consistent with dispersed high-aspect ratio rods. Details of the electrical conductivity\u2013morphology\u2013deformation relationship will be discussed in future publications.", "Note, that since the as-received powder is a weak aggregate of the carbon nanotubes, accessibility of the solution to the nanotube surface is relatively facile. This contrasts the relatively small fraction of accessible nanoparticle surface found in nanoparticles that form low-dimensional crystallites. This includes single wall carbon nanotubes, which occur in ropes [bib15], and layered silicates (clays), which occur in tactoids [bib16]. The minimal nanoparticle surface area accessible by bulk solutions in these cases implies that comparable solution mixing procedures without surface initiated chemistries, such as used here in, are not nominally successful in forming well-dispersed nanocomposites starting from nanounits arranged in low-dimensional crystallites."]], ["Characterization", ["Mechanical evaluation was conducted on a Tinius Olson H10KS bench top tensile tester at a strain rate of 6mm/min.

Note, that since the experimental temperature (27\u00b0C) is intermediate between the glass transition (\u221245\u00b0C) and melting point of the soft-segment crystallites (50\u00b0C), attention to the impact of physical aging is critical to ensure comparability of experimental results. Overall, the absolute values of the moduli and yield strength were very dependent on the process history (solvent removal rate), thermal history and initial orientation of the CNT. CNT/PU nanocomposites may exhibit differences of modulus up to 100%; the lowest resulting from plasticization by residual solvent and the highest associated with increased soft-segment crystalline content after sample storage for 30 days as evaluated by DSC control experiments. These experiments also indicated that hard-segment crystallinity was much less sensitive to process history (hard-segment content only 10% according to NMR). For reproducibility, all samples discussed in [fig4] were prepared directly before the experiments to ensure comparable process history.", "Overall, the addition of the CNTs increases the modulus and strength of the Morthane without sacrificing deformability. The initial modulus, <i>E</i>, and engineering stress at the apparent yield point, <i>\u03c3</i>\n                        Y, increases roughly monotonically with CNT loading. The elongation at the apparent yield, <i>\u03bb</i>\n                        Y, decreases precipitously between 2 and 5wt% (1.14 and 2.9vol%) CNT and is approximately invariant at higher loadings. Although this transition occurs at loadings greater than electrical percolation, this behavior may reflect the failure of a reinforcing network of CNT and polymer crystallites, which occurs at higher loadings. This volume fraction of CNT also corresponds approximately to a rapid increase in the initial soft-segment crystallinity (see below). Continuing on, the onset of strain hardening, <i>\u03bb</i>\n                        H, decreases with CNT loading after an initial increase with respect to the neat resin. The stress, <i>\u03c3</i>\n                        H, correspondingly increases. Finally, the elongation at rupture decreases slightly with CNT loading; however even at 17wt% (10.2vol%) CNT, still results in a thermoplastic elastomer with 1200% elongation before failure.", "As noted, the mechanical characteristics of pure thermoplastic elastomers depend on the soft-segment crystalline content (see details on Morthane composition in [tbl1] and [sc1]). [fig5]\n                         summarizes the initial soft- and hard-segment crystalline content of the solvent cast films as determined by DSC. For low addition of CNT, the initial soft-segment crystalline content increases substantially, where as the CNTs have minimal impact on the hard-segment crystalline content. Thus, the reinforcement provided by CNTs to the solution cast Morthane films is not solely responsible for the improved mechanical characteristics, but its impact on crystallite formation must also be considered in a manner similar to other semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites [bib22]. The increase in soft-segment crystallites may arise from a reduction in the activation energy to form a critical nucleus at the CNT\u2013polymer interface (heterogeneous nucleation) or local regions of enhanced internal strain arising from mechanical percolation of the tubes and accommodation of the rigid tube inclusions during the drying process and associated volume reduction. Second DSC scans after soft-segment melting (<i>T</i>\n                        max=135\u00b0C, \u0394<i>T</i>=\u22124\u00b0C/min, <i>T</i>\n                        start=\u221270\u00b0C) do not indicate an increase in soft-segment crystallite content with increasing CNT content after these initial soft segment crystallites are melted. This initially implies that the increase in crystalline fraction with CNT content probably arises from inhomogeneous strain distribution created during solvent removal.", "The enhancement of crystallite content during solvent casting parallels the impact of nano-filler addition on isothermal and non-isothermal polymer crystallization. In general, the extreme interfacial area and particle number density in nanocomposite systems alters bulk polymer crystallization processes. For example, increased crystallinity and enhanced crystallization rates arising from the increased nucleation density afforded by the presence of functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes in polypropylene nanocomposites have been reported [bib23 bib24]. Comparable effects are routinely reported in semi-crystalline polymer layered silicate nanocomposites [bib25]. However, the role of dissimilar volume change between polymer and nanofiller, either arising from different thermal expansivity or solvent removal, are seldom discussed or specifically examined."]], ["Deformation\u2013morphology relation", ["Understanding the structural changes during deformation is necessary to unravel the various factors underlying the mechanical characteristics and conductivity\u2014strain relationship of these thermoplastic elastomer nanocomposites. A typical stress-elongation profile corresponding to the in situ deformation\u2014X-ray scattering experiments is shown in [fig6]\n                         for a 1wt% (0.57vol%) filled polyurethane. The sample was strained, held at the constant deformation for 2min and then the X-ray scattering data collected. After data collection, the sample elongation was increased and the procedure repeated. Since elastomers recover stress when constrained at a constant deformation, the protocol provided sufficient time for the sample to reach a steady state for data collection. Therefore, the X-ray data presented does not reflect the morphology during deformation at a constant strain rate but at the relaxed state for a given deformation\u2014the stress may decrease up to 50% compared to a continuous deformation.

The \u2018affine\u2019 deformation (components of vector length or end-to-end distance of each chain is changed in the same ratio as the corresponding dimensions of the bulk rubber) of a network of Gaussian chains can be equivalently understood from the perspective of thermodynamic elasticity [bib28] or strain invariants, such as storable elastic energy [bib29]. Starting from this foundation, the impact of various complexities, such as filler content, cross-link fluctuation, non-affine deformation (Phantom network theory [bib30]), distribution in cross-link functionality, chain constraints and free chains, can be discussed. To establish a connection to these previous efforts and begin to quantitatively understand the unique impact of nanoscale, high aspect fillers, on thermoplastic elastomers, it is instructive to compare the experimental data to these existing frameworks.", "The strain invariant approach of Mooney-Rivlin, extensively utilized for filled rubbers, provides a straightforward approach to examine the deviation of a complex elastomeric system from ideality.

C2 represents the non-Gaussian aspects of the network, such as physically (unstable) crosslinks. When C2=0, 2C1=G, the shear modulus and Eq. [fd6] reduces to the well-known expression for deformation of a Gaussian network [bib27].", "[fig14]\n                     a depicts the effective modulus (<i>\u03c3</i>/2(<i>\u03bb</i>\u2013<i>\u03bb</i>\n                     \u22122)) of the CNT-thermoplastic elastomers with respect to the inverse elongation ratio, <i>\u03bb</i>\n                     \u22121. Affine deformation of an ideal Gaussian network (C2=0) would appear as a horizontal line. The pure thermoplastic elastomer, Morthane, exhibits substantial non-ideality during deformation, attributed to meta-stability of physical crosslinks, complex morphology of hard-segment crystallites and strain-induced crystallization of soft-segments. Previous studies have revealed that the 10s of nanometer domains arising from phase separation of hard and soft-segments evolve with deformation. This evolution of morphology is thought to be the primary source of hysteresis and cyclic softening.", "As the CNT loading increases the non-ideal behavior increases, especially at low deformation. After yield though (Morthane: <i>\u03bb</i>\u223c1.2; nanocomposites: <i>\u03bb</i>\u223c1.1\u20131.15) (see [fig4]b), the relative behavior of the nanocomposites is similar, irrespective of CNT loading.", "Flandin et al. observed similar results for the deformation of carbon-black containing elastomers and rationalized a modulus scaling factor to superimpose curves based on a hydrodynamic perspective, where the effective modulus at any deformation depends only on the amount of filler.", "Following Flandin et al. [bib31]. [fig14]b emphasizes the similarity between all the systems above yielding; implying that the mechanistics of deformation beyond the yield point is dominated by the elastomer, with minimal impact from the CNTs. Also notable in [fig14]b is the appearance of a threshold volume fraction at which all nanocomposites behave identical over the entire deformation range. Below 2.3vol% the reduced Mooney\u2013Rivlin curves deviate from this trend. In addition to CNT loading, the initial soft-segment crystallite content also changes between 0 and 5vol% CNT and may contribute to this behavior.", ["Initial modulus", ["Numerous phenomenological (\u2018spring and dash pot\u2019) and hydrodynamic based models have been developed to describe the impact of fillers on a rubber modulus. Fundamentally, the simplest models directly derived from morphological characteristics of the system are those processed by Guth and Simha in 1938 [bib32] and Smallwood in 1945 [bib33]. The key contribution to reinforcement in these models is the concept of \u2018hydrodynamic\u2019 [bib34 bib33] or \u2018strain\u2019 [bib35] amplification in which the rubber surrounding a rigid inclusion expresses (experiences) a local microscopic intrinsic strain, <i>\u03b5</i>\n                        0, that is in excess of the macroscopic external strain, <i>\u03b5</i>, of the sample by a factor <i>X</i>=<i>\u03b5</i>\n                        0/<i>\u03b5</i>, the stress amplification factor.

The basic assumption is that all interactions between contiguous sections of a material are localized at the surface of separation.", "A first order model to describe reinforcement of filled rubbers with anisotropic particles is the semi-empirical Guth [bib34] model with\n                           \n                              (7)\n                              \n                                 \n                                    E\n                                    /\n                                    \n                                       E\n                                       0\n                                    \n                                    =\n                                    1\n                                    +\n                                    0.67\n                                    \n                                       g\n                                       f\n                                    \n                                    \u03d5\n                                    +\n                                    1.62\n                                    \n                                       g\n                                       f\n                                       2\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       \u03d5\n                                       2\n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        where <i>E</i> is the modulus of the composite; <i>E</i>\n                        0 is the modulus of the neat matrix elastomer; <i>\u03d5</i> is the volume fraction of the filler; and <i>g</i>\n                        f is the aspect ratio of the filler. This expression has subsequently been refined by numerous researchers [bib37]. Boyce provides a comparison of previous models [bib41]. Additionally, recent efforts by Boyce et al. qualitatively demonstrated inhomogeneous strain distribution in a two-dimensional model of uniaxially aligned rods in a soft matrix [bib47].", "The relative initial moduli, <i>E</i>/<i>E</i>\n                        o for various CNT/PU nanocomposites are plotted in [fig15]\n                        a. Three batches of CNT/PU are displayed that differ in their thermal history and demonstrates the influence of thermal annealing at room temperature on mechanical properties of the CNT/PU system. To compare to classic carbon-black filled elastomers, data after Boyce et al. [bib41] are included in [fig15]b. Additionally, to compare the CNT/PU nanocomposites to other nanocomposite elastomers, previously reported data from layered silicate\u2013elastomer nanocomposites are included in [fig15]a. For reference, the upper- and lower bounds to modulus enhancement derived from axial (Voigt model) and transverse (Reuss model) loading of an infinite, uniaxial arrangement of reinforcement and filler with a moduli ratio of 100 are also included [bib42].", "The relative initial moduli of elastomers containing traditional fillers cluster along a trend line with increasing volume fraction of filler. Boyce and co-workers demonstrated that many of the hydrodynamic models, such as Guth\u2013Gold or Sheng\u2013Boyce [bib47], can capture this general trend to the first order irrespective of the chemical and morphological details of the system. Positive deviations (higher relative modulus) are normally attributed to effective filler particles with slight aspect ratios (<i>g</i>\n                        f=2\u20135). With respect to the initial reinforcement, this emphasizes the critical role of volume fraction and the relative moduli of the filler, <i>E</i>\n                        f, to that of the matrix, <i>E</i>\n                        m, over specific chemical details.", "The substantially greater aspect ratio of the nanounits results in larger relative initial modulus at lower volume fractions in [fig15]a. In the same manner as classic fillers, the relative initial moduli for these elastomeric nanocomposites also cluster, irrespective of specific details of the nanoparticle, morphology or elastomer (e.g. crystalline content, crosslink density). The tensile modulus, <i>E</i>\n                        1, of montmorillonite has been estimated at \u223c 230GPa [bib43] and of CNT used herein at \u223c600GPa [bib44]. Aspect ratios for an individual montmorillonite layer were around 100 [bib45] and for the CNTs were in excess of 100 (CNT diameter \u223c100nm, length >10\u03bcm) [bib4]. Overall this clustering implies that aspect ratio is the most critical factor for reinforcement of elastomers by nanoparticles that are many orders of magnitude stiffer than the matrix. The impact of increased aspect ratio asymptotically approaches continuous reinforcement as stress-transfer enables complete utilization of the stiffness of a larger fraction of the reinforcement [bib46]. Comparably, extreme differences between filler and matrix modulus minimizes the ability to fully capitalize on additional increases in filler stiffness [bib47] and thus utilization of fillers with moduli, <i>E</i>\n                        f, that differ by 2\u20133 times but are 100s of times more rigid than the matrix, <i>E</i>\n                        m, yield comparable reinforcement.", "Although the experimental results can be described by the hydrodynamic models, the parameters derived do not correlate with the characteristics of a single nano-particle. For example, for the semi-empirical Guth [bib32] model, the trend represented by the cluster of nanocomposite data can be described with <i>g</i>\n                        f=20\u201325 and <i>E</i>\n                        f/<i>E</i>\n                        m=100-substantially lower than initially anticipated. Some of the data sets may imply greater aspect ratios at low volume fractions, but in general there is insufficient information at these very low loadings to yield reliable values. Overall, the experimental values are substantially less than what the Guth model would predict for aspect ratios or for relative moduli greater than 100.", "Three, interrelated reasons associated with the actual distance between nanoparticles form the core of this discrepancy\u2014realistic morphology, finite nanoparticle rigidity and particle-particle correlations. First, the available morphological characterization indicates that the distribution of nanoparticles in these nanocomposites are probably far from ideal, where ideal dispersion is defined when the mean-distance between individual particles equals the maximum possible distance between particles for a given volume fraction. This implies that on a meso- or micro-scale level concentration fluctuations of reinforcement particles occur, creating a hierarchical morphology and stress and strain distribution must be considered at multiple length scales. Additionally, the local correlations between these anisotropic particles, such as represented by a meso-scale domain where local orientation correlation of particles is high, even though the macroscopic, global orientation correlations are isotropic, may result in particles acting in concert\u2014as a larger-scale effective reinforcement phase with a smaller effective aspect ratio.", "Second, the nano-reinforcement is not infinitely rigid. Micrographs indicate that before deformation, the tubes and layers are bent and distorted within the nanocomposites. The initial aspect ratio will be smaller than the idealized end-to-end distance. Since these nanoparticles do not have isotropic moduli\u2013the transverse modulus (\u223c56GPa for montmorillonite [bib43] and \u223c50GPa for SWNT [bib48] and for MWNT [bib49]) is substantially less than the longitudinal modulus\u2014less than optimal reinforcement may arise from a random arrangement of orthotropic reinforcing phase. The low buckling stress for high aspect ratio structures will also lead to particle distortions dependent on process history. This is especially true for the carbon\u2013nanotubes examined in this study [bib50].", "Finally, the hydrodynamic models are developed with respect to an isolated particle. As aspect ratio increases, the volume fraction decreases when particle-particle correlation occurs, for example through simple volume exclusion. Although the former issues cannot be disregarded, the volume fractions for the majority of the nanocomposite data are greater than the onset of particle\u2013particle correlation or percolation thresholds, which for aspect ratios greater than 100 are roughly <i>\u03d5</i>\n                        c\u22640.001 as delineated by simple excluded volume arguments [bib51 bib52]. Thus the loadings are generally contrary to the underlying assumptions of the hydrodynamic models, which presuppose an isolated rigid phase. In addition, the nanoscale dimensions imply that for a given volume fraction as nanofiller size decreases, the number density of filler particles and mean distance between particles decreases. The extreme number density associated with fully dispersed nanofillers result in diminishingly small distance between nanoparticles\u2014comparable to the size of the nanoparticle at <i>\u03d5</i>=0.01\u20130.1. Since the spatial decay of the interfacial stress and strain distribution in the soft phase at an interface with a rigid phase is invariant to the thickness of the rigid phase, these distributions will overlap leading to very inhomogeneous stress and strain distributions within the nanocomposites. Recent work [bib47] by Boyce et al. has demonstrated that for uniaxially aligned, high aspect ratio fillers, strain shielding associated with particle\u2013particle spatial correlation develop. This leads to reinforcement by an effective-particle, where the load is distributed over a collection of rods. This leads to a reinforcing phase with lower effective modulus and lower aspect ratio than would be derived from consideration of only the fundamental rod unit."]], ["Deformation", ["The inelastic, viscoelastic and failure modes of nanocomposites, as with traditional filled polymers, are substantially more complex to understand and correlate to generalized frameworks. Overall, the similarity between the pure Morthane and nanocomposite at deformations beyond the yield point imply that the presence of the CNTs do not alter the mechanistics of viscoelastic deformation. This is very surprising given the substantial morphological change, both for the content of soft-segment crystallites and the continual increase of CNT orientation with deformation as revealed by the X-ray scattering experiments. Following with hydrodynamic description of reinforcement, the inverse of the modulus scaling factor used to create the reduced Mooney\u2013Rivlin analysis above ([fig14]b) may be ostensibly analyzed in the same fashion discussed for the relative modulus enhancement, where the modulus scaling factor provides a measure of \u2018reinforcement\u2019 beyond yielding. [fig16]\n                         summarizes the modulus scaling factor and comparable analysis using Eq. [fd7] and following Flandin et al. yields an aspect ratio of only 9. This is substantially less than observed for the initial modulus and what initially would be expected, since elongational deformation increases CNT alignment and thus directional reinforcement.", "A likely explanation for this behavior is the poor interfacial bonding between the thermoplastic elastomer and CNT. Even though SEMs ([fig1]) indicate good wetting of the matrix on the tube, after <i>\u03bb</i>\u223c5, debonding and void formation may be reducing the impact of the CNT on the mechanisms of stress distribution and strain accommodation at high elongation. In support, [fig9] shows residual void formation within a 10wt% (5.9vol%) CNT nanocomposite elongated to <i>\u03bb</i>=5 and then allowed to fully recover to a zero-stress state, resulting in a \u223c250% permanent deformation (<i>\u03bb</i>=3.5). As a final note, the impact of the filler on the local dynamics of the matrix may also play a role in the relative modulus enhancement and deformation behavior, especially as the matrix\u2013filler interfacial area increases as reinforcement size decreases. For example, the effect of constrained entropy (trapping of entanglements and the effects on matrix chain mobility) derived from polymer-nanoparticle interaction proposed by Sternstein and co workers [bib53 bib54] may play an important role in nanocomposite reinforcement, especially when discussed with regards to cyclic deformation [bib55] (not addressed herein).", "Overall, substantially more experimental and theoretical efforts are required to establish generality of the cluster of the relative moduli of elastomeric nanocomposites and to provide a fundamental understanding of the contributing factors."]]]], ["Conclusion", ["In summary, a complex interplay between nucleation and strain induced crystallization, polymer crystallite orientation and tube alignment underlie the reinforcing effect of multi-wall CNT on Morthane. Incorporation of as little as 2.9vol% of CNTs into the thermoplastic polyurethane increases yield stress, stress at break and modulus, without loosing the ability to stretch the elastomer above 1000%. These properties are influenced by a strain-induced crystallization of the soft-segments of the PU, which leads to a complex synergism in the mechanical reinforcement of PU nanocomposites. This synergism also carries over to the alignment of CNTs during deformation. The alignment of soft-segment crystallites is enhanced at low deformations (<i>\u03bb</i><2) in the presence of CNTs and is suppressed at higher elongations (<i>\u03bb</i>>3\u20134). CNT orientation (<i>S</i>\n                     d\u223c0.5) is lower than that of the polymer crystallites (<i>S</i>\n                     d\u223c0.8) and is not influenced by an increase in CNT concentration within the examined volume fraction range. A general clustering of modulus values is observed irrespective of polymer details. This indicates that more comprehensive considerations are required with respect to the application of first order models to define \u2018ultimate possibilities\u2019. Viscoelastic deformation after yielding is similar for the CNT/PU nanocomposites and pure PU, indicating that the mechanism of deformation beyond the yield point is governed by the polymer matrix.", "Overall, uniaxial elongation in combination with in situ X-ray studies indicate that nanotube orientation and polymer deformation are coupled, altering the strain induced soft-segment crystallinity and the mechanical response of the nanocomposites at increasing strain. The complex interrelation implies that the extensive characterization discussed herein is necessary, but still not sufficient to effectively establish deformation\u2013morphology relationships for nanotube containing elastomers, especially with respect to failure and yielding phenomena."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.polymer.2005.02.025"}
