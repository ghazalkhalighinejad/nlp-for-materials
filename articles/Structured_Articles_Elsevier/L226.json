{"title": "Epoxy/graphene platelets nanocomposites with two levels of interface strength", "abstract": "Graphene platelets (GP) are a novel class of nanofillers due to its good compatibility with most polymers, high aspect ratio, high absolute strength and cost-effectiveness. We in this study synthesised two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites with different interface strength using the combination of sonication and chemical modification. Although the surface-modified graphene platelets (<i>m</i>-GP) formed clusters, a higher degree of dispersion and exfoliation of graphene was observed in each cluster owning to the improved interface by modification. The scrolling of graphene was found predominantly in the interface-modified nanocomposite. At 4\u00a0wt%, the modified nanocomposite shows fracture energy release rate <i>G</i>1c\n                      613.4\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122, while the unmodified nanocomposite indicates 417.3\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122, in comparison with neat epoxy <i>G</i>1c\n                      204.2\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122. The interface modification enhanced the glass transition temperature of neat epoxy from 94.7 to 108.6\u00a0\u00b0C, 14.7% increment. Toughening mechanisms are attributed to the voiding, microcracking and breakage of GP, while matrix may not consume as much fracture energy as <i>m</i>-GP do.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Polymers are well known for their high specific strength and flexibility. However, many polymers, e.g. rubbers and thermoset resins, have either low absolute strength or poor fracture toughness, limiting their applications across industries. To remedy these shortcomings, polymers are often compounded with a variety of fillers including carbon black, carbon nanotubes, clay, silica and polymeric particles; of these, carbon-based fillers are of great significance in scientific research and product development\u2014carbon black is a major type of fillers in rubber industry and carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied for the past decades. Despite the research of carbon nanotubes, it has not yet reached a situation where carbon nanotubes are ideal for reinforcing or toughening polymers, because of expensive manufacturing costs (such as single wall carbon nanotubes), high viscosity caused by the \u201cbird\u2019s nest\u201d structure of the entangled tubes, and high anisotropic functionality. By contrast, graphene platelets (GP) are a new class of filler comprising one or more layers of a graphene plane which is of exceptional functionalities, high mechanical strength (1\u00a0TPa in Young\u2019s modulus and 130\u00a0GPa in ultimate strength) and chemical stability, for the following reasons: their abundance in nature and thus their cost-effectiveness; their extremely high specific surface area, which carries higher levels of transferring stress across interface and provides higher reinforcement [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8] than carbon nanotubes; their isotropic electrical/thermal conductivities on the graphene plane; their low viscosity when compounded with polymer; and their non-toxicity. Although GP can be produced from thermal shock at over 500\u00a0\u00b0C, we will fabricate GP by sonication in this study.", "Epoxy resins are widely used as adhesives, coatings, structural materials and compositae matrix. However, epoxy resins are inherently brittle, which makes them vulnerable to micro-cracks produced in service, and this limits their applications. Extensive studies have thus been conducted to toughen epoxy resins using rubbers, thermoplastics, inorganic particles etc. Rubber and thermoplastic toughening methods require a substantial amount of toughener, e.g. 15\u201320\u00a0wt%, which causes loss of other desirable properties. Polymers containing layered silicate nanofillers have shown the greatest mechanical and barrier properties, and attracted the most extensive research and development due to the fillers\u2019 high specific surface area, functionality and cost-effective fabrication. Unfortunately, the silicate has proved not highly effective in toughening epoxy due to the weak interface between silicon-based layers and carbon-based resins [bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12].", "GP consisting of carbon atoms are more compatible with epoxy resins and thus produce a stronger interface than the silicate. Yasmin prepared epoxy/graphite nanocomposites by mixing epoxy with graphite in solvent; 4\u00a0wt% graphite increases Young\u2019s modulus by 10% and glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g\n                     ) from 143 to 145\u00a0\u00b0C [bib13]. When the mixing process was promoted by sonication and shear mixing, 1\u00a0wt% GP increase modulus 15%, but this is accompanied by a reduction of tensile strength [bib14]. Koratkar et al. very recently investigated the mechanical properties of epoxy/GP nanocomposites prepared by a similar approach. The epoxy fracture toughness was improved from 0.97 to 1.48\u00a0MPa\u00a0m1/2 at 0.1\u00a0wt% filler fraction, and the toughening mechanism was attributed to crack deflection by thin GP. Unfortunately, no data were available at higher filler fractions [bib15]. Interface plays a vital role in determining the mechanical and thermal properties of nanocomposites. Li and Kim employed UV/O3 to oxidise GP to create an improved interface between platelets and epoxy. The resulting nanocomposites showed a steady increase of <i>T</i>g\n                      and modulus with prolonging the UV/O3 treatment [bib16]. Miller presented a new approach to the functionalisation of GP by using a coupling agent which built covalent bonding between fillers and soft matrix (0.78\u00a0GPa Young\u2019s modulus), resulting in 50% modulus improvement at 1\u00a0wt% filler fraction [bib17]; a similar approach was reported by Chiang and Hsu to improve the flame-retardant performance of epoxy/GP nanocomposite [bib18].", "In spite of these studies, it is not clear the effect of interface strength on the structure and properties, in particular the fracture toughness and toughening mechanisms of these materials. Therefore, this study will synthesise two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites with different interface strength through the combination of sonication and chemical modification to investigate the effect of interface on the structure and properties of the nanocomposites."]], ["Experiments", [["Materials", ["Acid-treated Graphite, Asbury 3494, was provided by Asbury Carbons, Asbury, NJ.

Not shown here is that the sonication time longer than 30\u00a0min made no obvious improvement for the suspension. In conclusion, low sonication temperature is critical to the dispersion and exfoliation of graphite layers, while long time sonication may be unnecessary. Since graphite formed stable suspension by sonication, it should exist in solution in the form of graphene platelets (GP), as proved in the following TEM analysis."]], ["FTIR", ["[fig3]\n                         contains FTIR spectra of raw graphite, GP and <i>m</i>-GP.

A sharp peak at 2<i>\u03b8</i> of 26.38\u00b0 was observed for GP, corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.337\u00a0nm; this is caused by the removal of intercalates during purification. Upon modification, the peak broadens. Since great care was taken to ensure the same amount of GP and <i>m</i>-GP tested using an identical procedure, the broadening effect suggests that the modification changes the layer spacing. Actually, the \u2013OH groups of GP reacted with MDI during the modification as analysed in Section [sec3.2], which reduced the regularity of the stacked layers, thus broadening the diffraction of GP. The <i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite shows a more broadened peak with a small shoulder as circled in [fig4]; this implies that the modification facilitated the interaction of matrix molecules into the layer spacing of GP.

When magnified in [fig6]b, a cluster is found consisting of graphene platelets which contain a few exfoliated graphene layers as indicated by black arrows; this means that graphite exists in the form of GP in the nanocomposites. [fig6]c provides information: coexistence of intercalation as shown by white arrows and exfoliation by black arrows, and the wrinkling of graphene layers as circled. The coexistence is confirmed in [fig6]d, which also indicates a rolled structure of graphene as shown in a circle. The rolled structure is caused by curing. Curing epoxy is the formation of a network structure caused by the reactions of DGEBA with hardener, which is accompanied by a phase transition from liquid to solid. GP scrolled or folded during curing to reduce configurational entropy. The thinner the platelets, the more scrolls (resemble a small diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes [bib26 bib27]) created. Generally, a single graphene sheet has a tendency to scroll because it is thermodynamically unstable on a nanosize. When the phase transition occurred, (i) graphene platelets would form clusters if they had dispersed uniformly, and/or (ii) the density and size of clusters would increase if the platelets had dispersed as clusters, because aggregation could reduce configurational entropy; this phenomenon is somewhat similar to the phase separation in liquid rubber-toughened epoxy.", "The morphology of the 4\u00a0wt% epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite is shown in [fig7]\n                        .

This is explained in light of GP modification. As shown in Experiment, <i>m</i>-GP were modified by MDI; after modification, the unreacted MDI molecules were not removed for processing simplicity. These molecules bridged with matrix molecules, locking GP inside clusters; this increased the cluster size while reducing the cluster number, as supported by the\u00a0comparison of [fig6 fig7]. The modification resulted in the following: (i) bridging GP with matrix molecules for a high interface strength; (ii) promoting exfoliation; and (iii) increasing the cluster size while reducing the cluster number. Hence, there are not as many clusters of <i>m</i>-GP as those of GP in matrix. It means that GP create a higher stiffening and toughening effect at low fractions 0\u20132.5\u00a0wt% due to its higher cluster numbers than <i>m</i>-GP; at 4\u00a0wt%, the effect diminishes because the interface of clusters is not good and more clusters mean more regions of weak interface.

In contrast, epoxy is widely used across industries. However it is inherently brittle, which has attracted extensive interest from both universities and industries. Liquid rubber forms micron-sized particles in epoxy and produces a significant toughening effect, but it comes with the penalty of losing stiffness and strength. The same pros and cons incurred for microcapsule-toughened epoxy [bib35]. Nanoparticles-toughened resins avoid these disadvantages [bib29 bib36 bib37 bib38 bib39], due to their much smaller particle\u2013particle distance and much larger total particle surface area [see Fig.\u00a03 and Table 3 in Ref. [bib37] than their peer micron-sized particles. Although these nanotoughened resins have not shown more reinforcing effect than fibre laminate, a research shows that nanoclay-toughened polymer, when used as a matrix, promotes the stiffening and strengthening effect of fibres [bib40]. This implies that nanotoughened resins will replace conventional micron-sized toughened resins when these nanotoughened resins are sufficiently cost-effective."]], ["Dynamic mechanical analysis", ["In this study, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was employed to detect the interface effect on the thermal properties of the nanocomposites, as it is a convincing approach to provide comprehension knowledge of the interaction between filler and matrix.

A stress-whitened zone of \u223c5\u00a0mm in height is found in front of the crack tip in [fig12]a; a typical region is magnified in [fig12]b, which indicates a few clusters as shown by white arrows, corresponding to the clusters observed in [fig6]a; fracture phenomena shown in [fig12]c include voids and layer breakage as indicated by circles; [fig12]d demonstrates a number of cracks. In [fig13]\n                        a, the stress-whitened zone for epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite is as high as \u223c11\u00a0mm, over 50% increment of the zone for the epoxy/GP; this may indicate that the size-increased zone is able to consume more energy when fracture occurs, corresponding to a higher fracture toughness in [fig9]. Two features are shown in [fig13]b: a trench and clusters as indicated by black arrows and white arrows, respectively. Trenches are more popular for epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite in [fig13] than for the epoxy/GP in [fig12]; the appearance of trenches indicates a higher degree of surface deformation which consumes more fracture energy. The clusters in [fig13]b appear larger than those of the epoxy/GP in [fig12]b, corresponding to TEM analysis. A typical region of the clusters is magnified in [fig13]c, showing a number of white dots. Since these dots were not found in the clusters in [fig12], the dots must be organic molecules produced by the reactions of the grafted MDI with matrix molecules during modification. Epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite in [fig13]d shows a higher quantity of fracture phenomena\u2014voids and layer breakage\u2014than the epoxy/GP in [fig12]c. A region randomly selected in [fig13]d is magnified in [fig13]e where many tiny cracks are found; [fig13]f shows a clear image of the cracks which grow in the direction of crack propagation. While it is clear that the voids and layer breakage all occurred in GP, a new technique is needed to identify where these micro-cracks start from: matrix or GP. SEM elemental analysis is conducted to determine the carbon\u2013oxygen atom ratios of neat graphite, neat epoxy and the microcrack zone of the epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP fracture surface. At least five locations were measured for each sample. [tbl2]\n                         shows the comparison of the ratios for these samples. Since the C\u2013O atom ratio of the microcrack zone is similar to that of neat graphite, these micro-cracks must have initiated from GP and then grown under loading.", "A proposed toughening mechanism for epoxy/GP nanocomposites is crack deflection [bib15]\u2014a process where an initial crack tilts and twists when it encounters a rigid inclusion. This generates an increase in the total fracture surface area resulting in greater energy absorption as compared to the unfilled polymer material. The tilting and twisting of the crack front forces the crack to grow locally under mixed-mode (tensile/in-plane shear and tensile/anti-plane shear) conditions. Crack propagation under mixed-mode conditions requires a higher driving force than in mode I (tension), which also results in higher fracture toughness of the material. However, neither SEM micrographs of fractured CT nor in-depth fractography analysis was shown to support this claim.", "Based upon observation and analysis in [fig12 fig13], the toughening mechanisms of these two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites are proposed as below: (1) When subjected to loading, a high level of stress concentration occurs at the sharp crack tip, which induces local dilation since J230-cured epoxy is relatively ductile (see Fig.\u00a012 in Ref. [bib32]). Stress concentrates around each platelet due to the difference in modulus and Poisson ratio between matrix and GP. (2) With continued loading, fracture initiates from (i) the interface between GP and matrix, which is difficult to observe using SEM; and (ii) GP where voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks are created as shown in [fig12 fig13]. (3) Upon further loading, the voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks develop, causing catastrophic fracture. Since <i>m</i>-GP produced a stronger interface with matrix than GP, <i>m</i>-GP were able to carry a higher level of loading upon fracture, as indicated by the increased quantity of fracture features in [fig13].", "The toughening mechanisms of epoxy/GP nanocomposites are different to those of spherical nanoparticles-toughened epoxy. 20\u201330\u00a0nm silica particles induced, constrained and thwarted the nanovoids and matrix dilatation; neither interface debonding nor particle deformation was observed [bib36]. Depending on the matrix stiffness, either matrix shear banding or matrix plastic void growth played a major role in the toughening mechanisms of epoxy toughened by 55-nm rubber particles [bib37]. Regarding epoxy/GP nanocomposites, matrix deformation played a less important role in toughening mechanism, as nearly all fracture phenomena, such as voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks occurred in GP."]]]], ["Conclusions", ["Two types of epoxy nanocomposites were developed using graphene platelets (GP) in order to study the effect of interface strength on the morphology and properties of these materials, in particular fracture toughness, toughening mechanisms and thermal properties. GP were prepared through the combination of sonication and chemical modification. The chemical modification through grafting 4,4\u2032-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) into GP produced modified GP (<i>m</i>-GP), which subsequently reacted with matrix molecules during curing. The reactions bridged GP with matrix, building a strong interface. At 4\u00a0wt% GP, the interface modification created a further 96.1% increase of fracture energy release rate over the unmodified nanocomposite. The glass transition temperature of neat epoxy was increased from 94.7 to 108.6\u00a0\u00b0C at 2.5\u00a0wt% <i>m</i>-GP. Unlike particulate nanoparticles-toughened epoxy, more fracture energy was consumed by GP, since near all fracture features voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks occurred in GP."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.polymer.2011.02.003"}
