Carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposite foams possess high strength, low density, and can be made conductive. Good control of foam properties is of great importance in the application of such materials. In the current study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with controlled aspect ratio were used to alter the foam morphology in MWNT/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposite foams produced by a supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) foaming process. It was found that with the addition of one weight percent of MWNTs, the Young\u2019s modulus of polymer foams increased by as much as 82%, and the collapse strength increased by as much as 104%. The influence of MWNT aspect ratio on the compressive properties of nanocomposite foams was investigated. The addition of MWNTs influenced the foam properties in two ways: improving the compressive properties of the solid matrix, and reducing the bubble size of the nanocomposite foams. A modified constitutive model for predicting the compressive properties of high density closed-cell polymer foams was developed. The influence of the bubble size on the mechanical properties of polymer foams was discussed based on the new model.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Polymer nanocomposite foams, products from the foaming of polymer nanocomposites, have received increasing attention in both the scientific and industrial communities. The combination of functional nanofillers and foaming technology has a high potential to generate a new class of materials that are light, strong, and multifunctional. A small amount of well-dispersed nanofillers in a polymer matrix has been shown to serve as sites to facilitate bubble nucleation [bib1]. In addition, nanoscale particles can increase the modulus and strength of polymers [bib1 bib2]. Siripurapu et\u00a0al. [bib3] studied the morphology of silica/poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposites foamed by supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2). With increasing loading of well-dispersed nanosilica particles, the bubble density increased, and as a result, the bubble size decreased. Zhai et\u00a0al. [bib4] showed that the addition of nanosilica into polymers could lead to uniform bubble size in the foamed structure. With the presence of fillers, more bubbles start to nucleate concurrently, resulting in less gas for bubble growth, leading to a reduction of bubble size [bib5]. In addition, fillers increase the shear viscosity of polymer melts, which hinders bubble growth [bib6].", "Low density is one of the most attractive properties of polymer foams as a light weight substitute for structural or functional materials. However, the mechanical properties of polymer foams are almost always compromised after density reduction [bib7 bib8]. A combination of light weight and high strength has always been the major research objective in the research area of polymer foams. The mechanical properties of polymer foams not only depend on the intrinsic properties of the polymer, but also on the microstructure of the foam, such as bubble density, bubble size and bubble size distribution [bib8 bib9]. Alvarez et\u00a0al. [bib9], by using finite element modeling, predicted that the compressive elastic modulus showed a linear relationship with relative density of polymer foams when the relative bubble density is higher than 0.5. Their results agreed well with the experimental results of Saint-Michel et\u00a0al. [bib10]. Kabir et\u00a0al. [bib11] studied the tensile and mode-I fracture behavior of cross-linked polyvinyl chloride and rigid polyurathene foam, and found that the foam density and solid polymer intrinsic properties had a significant influence on tensile strength, modulus and fracture toughness of polymer foams.", "Nanofillers are commonly used to reinforce polymer foams. Saha et\u00a0al. [bib12] found that with the addition of 0.5 weight percent carbon nanofibers, the mode-I fracture toughness of rigid polyurethane foams increased by 28%. They proposed that the smaller bubble size, due to the addition of carbon nanofibers, reduced the effective bending stress on neighboring bubbles around the crack. In addition, the presence of dispersed nanoparticles at the edge of a bubble could act as crack arrest centers by creating multiple crack branching that could delay crack propagation. Mahfuz et\u00a0al. [bib13] found that the addition of three weight percent of TiO2 nanoparticles significantly increased (50\u201370%) the flexural strength and stiffness of polyurethane nanocomposite foams. The tensile properties of extruded polystyrene/carbon nanofiber composites were investigated by Shen et\u00a0al. [bib14]. They found that the tensile modulus of polystyrene foams increased with increasing concentration of carbon nanofibers (CNF). When the fiber concentration reached 5% by weight, the tensile modulus of the CNF/polystyrene nanocomposite foams with a density of 0.69\u00a0g/cm3 was 1.07\u00a0GPa, which is comparable to that of solid polystyrene (1.26\u00a0GPa).", "Conductive polymer nanocomposite foams filled with carbon nanotubes have been receiving increasing attention. Such foams possess most of the properties of solid carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposites such as high electrical conductivity and enhanced mechanical properties but at reduced weight [bib15 bib16]. Their superior properties as effective electromagnetic interference shielding materials have been well studied [bib17 bib18].", "The influence of carbon nanotube properties such as aspect ratio and surface chemistry on the properties of solid polymer nanocomposites has been previously reported [bib15 bib18]. However, carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposite foams are more complex than their solid composites. The interactions between fillers, bubbles and matrix polymer and their influence on the properties of nanocomposite foams are still not fully understood. In addition, the properties of one component may affect the properties of the other two [bib19]. In our recent paper [bib19], we showed that the aspect ratio of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) had a significant influence on the foam morphology of MWNT/polymer nanocomposite foams. At constant MWNT concentration, nanocomposite foams filled with short MWNTs had greater bubble density and smaller bubble size than nanocomposite foams filled with long MWNTs. The aspect ratio of MWNTs has been shown to influence the mechanical properties of solid nanocomposites as well [bib20]. To achieve good control over the mechanical properties of MWNT/polymer nanocomposite foams, it is important to understand the influence of MWNT aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of the polymer nanocomposite foams.", "In the current study, poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, and MWNT/PMMA nanocomposites containing MWNT with controlled aspect ratios were foamed with supercritical CO2 at various conditions to generate foams with different density. Supercritical CO2 was chosen as the physical foaming agent due to its relatively low critical temperature (31\u00a0\u00b0C), low critical pressure (7.38\u00a0MPa) and non-toxic nature. Compression tests were done on all nanocomposite foams and neat PMMA foams. The Young\u2019s modulus and collapse strength of different samples were compared. In this paper, the influence of MWNTs and MWNT aspect ratio on the compressive properties of PMMA foams is discussed.

[fd2] is compared with the current experimental results of neat PMMA foams as well as nanocomposite foams in [fig8]\n                           . By fitting Eq. [fd2] with the relative modulus of neat PMMA foam, which has a relative density of 0.186, the value of <i>\u0278</i> was calculated to be 0.9. Dashed line in [fig8] presents the fit of Eq. [fd2] with this value of <i>\u0278</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.9. To demonstrate the change of the curve with the change of <i>\u0278</i> value, curves with different <i>\u0278</i> values were also shown as dotted lines. It can be seen that the Gibson\u2013Ashby model over-predicted the relative modulus of the polymer foams when the relative density was over 0.2. Such discrepancy is due to the simplified assumptions used in the Gibson\u2013Ashby model. In this model, the foam was assumed to be composed of lattice or rod like structures in which cellular walls and struts were modeled as structural shell and beam elements, respectively. The aspect ratio of the walls and struts (strut length/cross section area, or wall area/wall thickness) was assumed to be large. However, when the relative density of the foam is high, such an assumption is no longer valid [bib9]. In addition, the <i>\u0278</i> value is a constant that does not depend on foam density. This may not be true for real samples. At high densities, it is very hard to determine the <i>\u0278</i> value by this model.", "Naguib et\u00a0al. [bib27] developed a constitutive model for characterizing the compressive behavior of PMMA open-cell foams. They assumed that the foam is comprised of cubic cages with equal dimensions, as shown in [fig9]\n                           . They first calculated the relative density (<i>\u03c1</i>r\n                           ) of the foam based on the cubic unit, which is a function of the geometry (<i>l</i> and <i>t</i>) of the unit cell:\n                              \n                                 (4)\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          \u03c1\n                                          r\n                                       \n                                       =\n                                       \u2212\n                                       2\n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   (\n                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                         t\n                                                         l\n                                                      \n                                                   \n                                                   )\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                          3\n                                       \n                                       +\n                                       3\n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   (\n                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                         t\n                                                         l\n                                                      \n                                                   \n                                                   )\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                          2\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           When compression loading was applied to the unit cell, the relative modulus of the foam (<i>E</i>r\n                           ) was obtained by using the same beam theory that was used in the Gibson\u2013Ashby model [bib26]:\n                              \n                                 (5)\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          E\n                                          r\n                                       \n                                       =\n                                       \n                                          C\n                                          0\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          \n                                             \n                                                \n                                                   (\n                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                         t\n                                                         l\n                                                      \n                                                   \n                                                   )\n                                                \n                                             \n                                          \n                                          4\n                                       \n                                    \n                                 \n                              \n                           By combining Eqs.

[fd16 fd17], the relative modulus of the closed-cell foams can be calculated from the relative density.", "By substituting the experimental results of neat PMMA foam at <i>\u03c1</i>r\n                           \u00a0=\u00a00.186 and <i>E</i>r\n                           \u00a0=\u00a00.0476 into Eqs. [fd16 fd17], <i>\u03b2</i> is calculated to be 1.5. The relative modulus of various samples as a function of relative density is presented in [fig10]\n                            with the Gibson\u2013Ashby fit (<i>\u0278</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.9) and the model proposed in the current work (with <i>\u03b2</i>\u00a0=\u00a01.5). It can be seen from that the constitutive model proposed in the current work represents the experimental data quite well when the relative density is below 0.5. When the relative density is higher than 0.5, the model tends to underestimate the relative modulus. There are many possible reasons that can lead to this discrepancy. First, the assumption that the face thickness is equal to edge thickness is not true for real composites, and there is always a distribution of edge and face sizes in a foam. Second, at high density, when the inter cell distance is on the same order as the cell size, then the edge thickness is on the same order as the edge length, and beam theory is no longer applicable for calculating the elastic modulus. Third, the shape of the unit cell in real foams is never cubic. At high density (low bubble density), the cells tend to be spherical because they are separated instead of coalesced. And last, the relative modulus is calculated based upon the elastic modulus of bulk solid polymer and nanocomposites. The true value of <i>E</i>solid\n                            is hard to get for polymer foams because the foaming process may also influence the properties of the polymer due to, for example, polymer-chain alignment [bib26].

This is possibly due to the small cell size of the nanocomposite foam due to the presence of nanofillers as nucleating agents. As the cell size gets smaller, the beam-bending concept breaks down because the cell walls become short and squat and they yield axially before they bend."]], ["The influence of cell size on the compressive properties of polymer foams", ["It was found that the relative modulus of the nanocomposite foams is higher than that of neat PMMA foam particularly at high relative densities ([fig10]). In addition, the relative modulus of <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i> foams is higher than that of <i>F</i>-<i>C100</i> foams. Since the relative modulus is normalized by the elastic modulus of the solid material (neat PMMA), the observed deviation in the relative modulus should not have been caused by differences in elastic modulus of the solid material but rather should be due to differences in the foam morphology of the foams.", "In [tbl1], the average bubble radii of <i>F</i>-<i>C100</i>, <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i> and neat PMMA foamed at various temperatures are summarized. According to [fig2 fig8], the relative density of the nanocomposites and neat PMMA foamed under the same conditions is similar, but the bubble size differs. <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i> foams always have the smallest bubble size and neat PMMA foams always have the largest bubble size at the same relative density. When the relative density is low, the relative modulus of both nanocomposite foams and neat PMMA foams are the same suggesting that the influence of bubble size on the relative modulus is negligible at low relative densities. However, when the relative density is high, the influence of bubble size on the relative modulus becomes significant.", "In the proposed constitutive model, the relative density (<i>\u03c1</i>r\n                           ) is a function of cell edge inverse aspect ratio, <i>A</i>r\n                            (<i>t</i>/<i>l</i>).

Thus, one relative density can only lead to one predicted relative modulus, without the influence of unit cell size (<i>l</i>).", "However, the experimental results show that at the same relative density, there can be more than one value of relative modulus. This discrepancy is possibly due to the simple cubic unit that was used in the derivation of the constitutive model.

The Young\u2019s modulus and collapse strength of PMMA foams increased significantly with the addition of 1% MWNT by weight. The addition of MWNTs influenced the properties of nanocomposite foams not only by influencing the matrix properties, but also by influencing the foam morphology. Under the same foaming conditions, the PMMA foams filled with long MWNTs (<i>F</i>-<i>C100</i>) showed greater Young\u2019s modulus and collapse strength values than the PMMA foams filled with short MWNTs (<i>F</i>-<i>C20</i>). However, the relative modulus and relative strength (relative with respect to unfoamed nanocomposite) of the <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i> foam is greater than those of the <i>F</i>-<i>C100</i> foam. The bubble density of <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i> foams was found to be greater than that of <i>F</i>-<i>C100</i>, which led to smaller average bubble size in <i>F</i>-<i>C20</i>. Therefore, we conclude that the differences observed in the compressive properties were directly related to the foam morphology of the foamed nanocomposite.", "A modified constitutive model for predicting the compressive mechanical properties of closed-cell polymer foams was developed. The Young\u2019s modulus and collapse strength predicted by the new model fit the experimental results better than the Gibson\u2013Ashby model. The proposed constitutive model can be used to predict the compressive mechanical properties of polymer foams with relative densities lower than 0.5.", "The influence of cell (bubble) size on the mechanical properties of polymer foams was discussed using the proposed constitutive model. It was found that at constant relative density, foams with smaller cell sizes have greater Young\u2019s modulus and collapse strength than those with larger cell sizes. It was also found that at constant relative density, the wall thickness to cell size ratio (<i>A</i>r\n                     ) increased when the cell size decreased, which led to greater relative modulus values."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.polymer.2011.04.050"}
