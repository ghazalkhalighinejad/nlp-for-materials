There have been many attempts using various techniques to develop high performance organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials, which combine the features of inorganic and organic substances. Such hybrid materials have been investigated at various scales from the level of microscale order to molecular order. Organic polymer materials exhibit excellent flexibility, toughness, moldability, and adhesiveness, but their heat resistance properties are inferior to those of inorganic materials. On the other hand, inorganic materials show high elastic modulus, heat resistance, corrosiveness, weather resistance, solvent resistance, and mechanical strength, but they are very brittle and their moldability is very poor. Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials obtained by combining organic polymers with inorganic compounds at the nanoscale or molecular level, are expected to exhibit high performance in all properties. The materials properties of conventional organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials produced by mixing or dispersing inorganic materials in organic polymers are mainly determined by the nature of the interface between the organic and inorganic components, as well as by the size and dispersibility of the inorganic filler material. In order to obtain high performance hybrid materials, the inorganic component must be dispersed minutely and homogeneously in the organic polymer matrix, and there must also be good adhesion at the interface between the inorganic and organic components. However, in the conventional composite materials described above, poorer physical properties are often observed in the composite material when minute inorganic filler particles are used, due to the difficulty of achieving homogeneous dispersion. Because of the shortcomings of conventional composite materials, research has been widely conducted on organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials containing inorganic oxides such as silica, titania, and zirconia dispersed at the nanoscale in polymer matrices by the sol\u2013gel method [bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10]. This method, which employs alkoxysilanes such as tetraethoxysilane, has been investigated extensively. However, the condensation temperature of the sol\u2013gel reaction is limited by the thermal properties of the polymer matrix used in the hybrid material, that is to say, lower condensation temperatures in sol\u2013gel reactions lead to incomplete condensation of Si\u2013OH groups. The remaining Si\u2013OH groups exert a deleterious influence on the transparency and thermal properties of the final hybrid material. To prevent this problem, several methods to introduce silica particles (with or without surface modification) into a polymer matrix have been reported [bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. Although properties such as elastic modulus and surface hardness were improved, a silane coupling agent such as \u03b3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane still had to be applied in improve adhesion at the organic\u2013inorganic interface.", "In this study, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl isocyanate (MOI) was employed as the surface modifier and reactive silica nanoparticles were prepared by the reaction between the Si\u2013OH groups of silica particles dispersed in ethyl acetate and the isocyanate groups of MOI. With this method, polymerizable groups could be introduced onto silica particles (thereby modifying the silica surface) without the generation of by-products such as alcohol or water, and without leaving a significant amount of residual Si\u2013OH groups. The reactive silica nanoparticles were copolymerized with methylmethacrylate using benzoyl peroxide as an initiator to obtain hybrid materials whose physical properties were subsequently investigated. The aim of this study was to develop a novel organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material with high mechanical performance."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials", ["2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethyl isocyanate (MOI) was supplied by Showa Denko K.K. and was used as received.
