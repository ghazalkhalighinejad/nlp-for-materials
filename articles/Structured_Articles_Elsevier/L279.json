{"title": "PMMA\u2013titania nanocomposites: Properties and thermal degradation behaviour", "abstract": "Titania nanoparticles were prepared using a sol\u2013gel method and calcination at 200 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C in order to obtain anatase and rutile phases, respectively. The obtained powders were used to prepare PMMA\u2013titania nanocomposites by a melt compounding method. The effect of the crystalline phase and the amount of\u00a0titania, in the range 1\u20135\u00a0wt.%, on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMA was investigated by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C{1H}CP-MAS NMR), including the measurement of proton spin\u2013lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1\u03c1(H)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1(H)) and cross polarization times (<i>T</i>\n                     CH), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Results showed that both types of titania were well dispersed in the polymeric matrix, whose structure remained amorphous. The two types of nanoparticles influenced the degradation of the polymer in different ways because of their different carbon content, particle size and crystal structures.", "body": [["Introduction", ["Incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into a polymer matrix has led to composites with improved thermal and mechanical properties [bib1 bib2 bib3]. There are a number of recent papers reporting on thermal degradation studies on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) containing boehmite, alumina, iron oxide and different clays [bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9]. It was found that metal oxides have a pronounced effect on the morphology, as well as mechanical and thermal behaviour of PMMA. Some authors found that the well dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles in PMMA improved its mechanical properties, and increased its thermal stability and activation energy of thermal degradation [bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]. These observations were attributed to strong interfacial interaction and stabilization of the free radicals by the inorganic compounds. However, Laachachi <i>et\u00a0al</i>., in their investigation of PMMA nanocomposites with organically modified clays, found a decrease in the thermal stability of PMMA and attributed it to a catalytic effect of the clays on PMMA degradation [bib9].", "The introduction of titania (TiO2) into a PMMA matrix received much attention due to improvements in the glass transition and thermal stability of the composites. Several methods have been used to prepare poly(methyl methacrylate)-titania (PMMA\u2013TiO2) nanocomposites, including <i>ex-situ</i> sol\u2013gel polymerization, radical polymerization and solution mixing [bib2 bib3 bib10]. For nanocomposites prepared <i>via in situ</i> bulk polymerization it was found that the presence of TiO2 retarded the thermal decomposition of the polymer [bib11]. This was attributed to the excellent interaction of the polymer chains with the TiO2 nanoparticles and the barrier effect to the evaporation of small molecules generated during the thermal decomposition of the PMMA matrix. The opposite trend, where the presence of TiO2 in a PMMA matrix did not enhance the thermal stability, was also observed and it was associated with the evaporation of physisorbed water [bib12]. Storage and loss modulus, glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>\n                     g), pendulum hardness and activation energy of the thermal degradation of the nanocomposites increased with increasing TiO2 content in PMMA\u2013TiO2 nanocomposites [bib13]. It was also found that the presence of TiO2 in the PMMA matrix could lead to a decrease in <i>T</i>\n                     g \n                     [bib2]. The decrease in this case was associated with significant formation of agglomerates and poor interaction. In another study the decrease in <i>T</i>\n                     g was attributed to the increased length of the polymer chains grown from the nanoparticles due to increased polymerization time [bib14].", "PMMA\u2013TiO2 nanocomposites prepared <i>via</i> solution mixing were also investigated [bib15 bib16]. The nanocomposites showed significant improvement in mechanical performance, thermal stability, glass transition temperature and activation energy of thermal degradation of the PMMA. Similar results were found for PMMA-TiO2 nanocomposites prepared through extrusion and rheometer mixing [bib17 bib18 bib19]. In these cases the titania was synthesized and modified by pure catechol. The improvement in the properties was attributed to good interfacial interaction and nanoparticles dispersion, which led to immobilization of the polymer chains. In contrast, the unmodified nanoparticles showed a decrease in glass transition which was linked to repulsive interaction with the surrounding polymer chains [bib15].", "A review paper on the photoinduced reactivity of titanium dioxide [bib20] discusses the differences between anatase and rutile titania, all of which may cause the nanoparticles of these two titania phases to interact differently when incorporated into a polymer matrix. First of all the exposed planes of these nanoparticles are different because, although both anatase and rutile titania have octahedral structures, anatase titania can be regarded to be built up from octahedrals that are connected by their vertices, while in rutile titania the edges are connected. Further it was found that the anatase phase has a different oxygen vacancy than the rutile phase, as well as higher electron mobility, lower dielectric constant, lower density, lower deposition temperature and lower surface energy. Both these titania phases were found to have catalytic properties.", "Most of the reported studies concentrated on commercial anatase titania incorporated in PMMA, while little information was provided regarding incorporation of the rutile phase into PMMA. No systematic comparison of the properties of PMMA\u2013TiO2 nanocomposites, containing respectively anatase and rutile titania, has been reported in literature. The purpose of this study was to prepare PMMA\u2013TiO2 nanocomposites, containing anatase and rutile titania respectively, through melt compounding, and analysing the sample morphologies as well as their degradation and thermomechanical behaviour. The\u00a0fillers were prepared by using sol\u2013gel combustion methods. The\u00a0nanoparticles and the composites were characterized using oriented finite element analysis (OFE), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR), including the measurement of proton spin\u2013lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1\u03c1(H)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i>\n                     1(H)) and cross polarization times (<i>T</i>\n                     CH), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and TGA-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA\u2013FTIR)."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials", ["Titanium isopropoxide (Ti(i\u2013OPr)4, Sigma Aldrich), nitric acid (Sigma Aldrich), and glycine (Sigma Aldrich) were used as received.

Titanium isopropoxide, Ti(i\u2013OPr)4, was hydrolysed for 1\u00a0h under magnetic stirring to obtain titanyl hydroxide, TiO(OH)2. The obtained titanyl hydroxide was reacted with nitric acid (1\u00a0h) to produce an aqueous solution of titanyl nitrate [TiO(NO3)2] that was used as the precursor for the synthesis of titania. The molar ratio Ti(i\u2013OPr)4:H2O and of TiO(OH)2:HNO3 was fixed at 1:4. The aqueous solution of titanyl nitrate was mixed with glycine (glycine:titanyl nitrate molar ratio\u00a0=\u00a02) and ammonium nitrate (glycine:NH4NO3 molar ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.5) followed by heating in an oven at 80\u00a0\u00b0C until complete dehydration. The obtained gel was ignited in an electric furnace at 450\u00a0\u00b0C. Once ignited, the combustion process was completed in a very short time (5\u00a0min) with the appearance of flame. After the synthesis, the slightly agglomerated titania powder was divided in two parts that were thermally treated in air for 2\u00a0h at 200\u00a0\u00b0C and at 600\u00a0\u00b0C in order to crystallize the anatase and rutile phases, respectively.

A few tens of a milligram of the powders were dispersed in 2\u00a0mL of isopropanol and a small drop of the dispersion was deposited on a 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grid, which was introduced into the TEM analysis chamber after complete solvent evaporation.

This rigidity increase favoured the cross polarization mechanism yielding smaller <i>T</i>\n                        CH values.

The presence of anatase TiO2 does not show much influence on the storage and loss modulus at lower temperatures, but these values are observably higher above the glass transition ([fig7]a and b). This suggests that the particles immobilized the polymer chains at higher temperatures, probably due to the increase in rigidity (as observed from the NMR results), although the higher carbon content in the particles could also have played a role. [fig8]a shows that 1 and 2% rutile TiO2 reduced the storage modulus values between 40 and 90\u00a0\u00b0C, probably because of a plasticizing effect of the titania nanoparticles on the PMMA matrix (the TEM results show less agglomeration in the case of the rutile titania nanoparticles), while 5\u00a0wt.% rutile TiO2 increased the storage modulus above the glass transition. It seems as if effective immobilization of the polymer chains only takes place at higher rutile titania content, which is in line with the NMR results that indicated less intense interaction between PMMA and rutile titania. The loss modulus curves follow the same trend ([fig8]b). Whatever the reason for the increased storage modulus, the difference in carbon content between the rutile and anatase phases, as confirmed through elemental analysis, could also have contributed to the differences in modulus.", "The glass transition temperature of PMMA generally increased in the anatase titania containing nanocomposites ([fig7]c). In the nanocomposites containing rutile titania, only the composite with 5% rutile titania showed a significant increase in the glass transition temperature.

Although these results and the <i>T</i>\n                        CH values obtained by NMR do not seem to support each other, it should be realized that the <i>T</i>\n                        CH values reflect the dipolar interactions within a nanometre scale and can therefore not be strictly correlated with the bulk thermal mechanical properties.

They all show a single-step degradation and an increase in char content with an increase in the titania amount. The degradation temperatures for the anatase titania system slightly moves to higher values with increasing nanoparticle content, whereas there was no significant change for the rutile titania system. This could be related to the interaction between the anatase titania and PMMA, according to NMR findings, which led to immobilization of free radical chains formed during degradation and/or hindering of the diffusion of volatile decomposition products. The results support the NMR observation in which the presence of anatase titania showed a more significant influence on polymer chain mobility than the rutile titania. Different authors suggested different mechanisms for the thermal stability improvement. Wang <i>et\u00a0al.</i> \n                        [bib1], in their study of PMMA/silica/zirconia nanocomposites, explained the improvement in thermal stability as being the result of the formation of networks of polymer chains and inorganic moieties which may restrain the movement of free radicals. In another study on PMMA/titania nanocomposites [bib30] they confirmed their view of radical trapping being the main degradation stabilization mechanism. However, Laachachi <i>et\u00a0al.</i> \n                        [bib31] proposed the restriction of polymer chain mobility as the mechanism for improvement in thermal stability. It therefore seems as if the issue has not been resolved yet, and it is quite possible that the improvement in thermal stability may be the result of a combination of radical trapping and polymer chain immobilization.", "The isoconversional graphs of ln\u00a0<i>\u03b2 versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> and ln (<i>\u03b2</i>/<i>T</i>\n                        2) <i>versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> were plotted from the TGA curves of PMMA, 95/5\u00a0w/w PMMA\u2013titania (anatase) and 95/5\u00a0w/w PMMA\u2013titania (rutile) at heating rates of 3, 5, 7 and 9\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0min\u22121.

These values fall within the range of activation energies for PMMA degradation reported previously [bib32 bib33]. The activation energy values of pure PMMA and its nanocomposites generally showed an increase with the degree of conversion. The increase in activation energy with an increase in degree of conversion during the degradation of polymers was observed and explained in several papers [bib32 bib33 bib34]. Gao <i>et\u00a0al.</i> \n                        [bib33] gave an acceptable explanation for the change in activation energy with increasing degree of degradation for PMMA.

The observation supports the increase in thermal stability of the PMMA\u2013TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposites observed in TGA. However, the presence of the rutile phase generally shows lower activation energy of degradation values. The decreased activation energy suggests that rutile titania may have acted as a catalyst for the thermal decomposition of the composites. Although the differences between the anatase and rutile titania phases (summarized in the \u2018Introduction\u2019 section) indicate that the anatase phase should have had a more significant catalytic effect, the differences in carbon contents in the two phases as well as the lower extent of agglomeration in the case of rutile titania may have contributed to the latter having a more significant catalytic effect.", "TGA\u2013FTIR analyses were done to establish the nature of the degradation product(s), and to confirm the observations from the kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation process of PMMA and 95/5\u00a0w/w PMMA-titania.

The carbonyl absorption vibration appears around 1744\u00a0cm\u22121 and the stretching vibration for C\u2013O is around 1167\u00a0cm\u22121. The peak at around 2336\u00a0cm\u22121 is related to the asymmetric stretching mode of CO2. No new peaks or peak shifts were observed for the nanocomposite samples. There is a clear increase in peak intensity for all the characteristic peaks with increasing temperature, it reaches a maximum, and decreases again with further increase in temperature. It can be observed that at around 400\u00a0\u00b0C the peaks of PMMA and the PMMA\u2013TiO2 (rutile) nanocomposite start to disappear, while that of the PMMA-TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite are still intense. It seems as if the volatilization of the degradation products is slower for the PMMA\u2013TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite, which implies more intimate contact between PMMA or MMA and anatase titania ([fig14]). This supports the improved thermal stability and higher activation energy of the PMMA\u2013TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite compared to the PMMA\u2013TiO2 (rutile) nanocomposite."]]]], ["Conclusions", ["Two types of titania, anatase and rutile, were successfully prepared and their structures were confirmed by XRD. Elemental analysis showed the presence of different carbon contents in these two types of nanoparticles. PMMA\u2013titania nanocomposites with both types of nanoparticles were prepared. TEM analysis showed that both rutile and anatase titania were well dispersed into the PMMA matrix (although that of rutile titania was slightly better) and did not change the amorphous structure of the PMMA. The fillers had different effects on the polymer chain mobility. NMR results showed different extents of interaction between PMMA and the two different types of titania. The two types of titania nanoparticles had slightly different influences on the thermomechanical properties of PMMA, as well as its degradation kinetics. These were probably the result of differences in particle size, extent of agglomeration, crystalline structure and carbon content. The quantification of the influence of these differences on the respective properties of the PMMA nanocomposites will be the subject of a separate study."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.05.022"}
