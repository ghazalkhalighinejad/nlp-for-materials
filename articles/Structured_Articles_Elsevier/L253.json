{"title": "The influence of matrix viscosity on MWCNT dispersion and electrical properties in different thermoplastic nanocomposites", "abstract": "Composites of MWCNTs having each three different levels of matrix viscosity with five different polymers (polyamide 12, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyetheretherketone and low density polyethylene) were melt mixed to identify the general influence of matrix viscosity on the electrical properties and the state of MWCNT dispersion. Huge differences in the electrical percolation thresholds were found using the same polymer matrix with different viscosity grades. The lowest percolation thresholds were always found in the composites based on the low viscosity matrix. The state of primary MWCNT agglomerate dispersion increased with increasing matrix viscosity due to the higher input of mixing energy. TEM investigations showed nanoagglomerated structures in the low viscosity samples which are obviously needed to achieve low resistivity values. The effect of nanotube shortening was quantified using two different viscosity grades of polycarbonate. Due to the higher mixing energy input the nanotube shortening was more pronounced in the high viscosity matrix which partially explains the higher percolation threshold.", "body": [["Introduction", ["In material science, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most promising new materials of the last few decades. The extremely high stiffness, electrical and thermal conductivity together with the extraordinarily high aspect ratio makes CNTs an ideal filler candidate for polymer nanocomposites [bib1 bib2 bib3]. Polymer-CNT-nanocomposites are on the threshold between scientific interest to industrial applications and therefore more and more new products are close to the market or are already available.", "Especially in electronics and automotive engineering, carbon nanotubes have gained great attention in recent years. For instance, Evonik Industries is producing moulding PA12 compounds containing CNTs for fuel lines [bib4]. These CNT modified materials prevent inflammable substances being ignited by electrostatic charges. Another example is the Piranha Unmanned Surface Vessel developed by Zyvex Technologies in 2010, a boat that utilizes an ultra-lightweight carbon nanotube enhanced composite material [bib5]. Together with Bayer MaterialScience LLC, Velozzi presented studies of plug-in multi-fuel hybrid electric vehicles. With the help of carbon nanotubes, the car parts are lighter and less brittle compared to the carbon fibre only composites which were used in the past [bib6]. In general, demand for carbon nanotubes could rise in the car industry in the next years. With their ability to form electrically conductive networks in a polymer matrix with very low filler contents [bib7 bib8], they are, for example, suitable for applications at the car body. CNT-polymer nanocomposites could replace metal parts where a certain level of conductivity is needed for electrostatic painting and therefore lead to a weight and cost reduction.", "Before CNT composites can be widely used, some difficulties in context with their processing still need to be solved. On industrial scale, multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are mainly produced by chemical vapour deposition. These as-produced MWCNTs are highly entangled and agglomerated. The complete dispersion of these agglomerates via melt mixing is hard to achieve and the state of dispersion is sensitive to the chosen processing conditions [bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13]. MWCNT dispersion, electrical and other properties of the composites are not only affected by the processing conditions, but also by the properties of the nanotubes and the polymer themselves. Among the polymer properties, the matrix viscosity plays a decisive role. A couple of studies have been published regarding the influence of the melt viscosity during the\u00a0MWCNT composite manufacturing. Min and Kim [bib14] described\u00a0an\u00a0increased surface resistivity of ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene (EPDM)-MWCNT nanocomposites when EPDM with higher viscosity was employed. Using SEM investigations Ha and Kim [bib15] observed a decrease of MWCNT dispersion for high molecular weight polypropylene (PP) and polycarbonate (PC) compared to low molecular weight PP and PC, even when higher shear stresses were applied. This unexpected result was explained by a restricted mobility of the MWCNTs when using high viscosity matrixes. In the investigated systems, the lowest percolation thresholds were found for the low viscosity PP and PC composites. The finding that nanocomposites\u00a0based on lower viscosity polypropylene had better performance compared to those based on the higher viscosity PP regarding the electrical properties is in accordance with results from Hwang et\u00a0al. [bib16]. Here the electrical percolation threshold was found between 2 and 3\u00a0wt.% for high and low viscosity PP based grades, but low viscosity PP-CNT composites showed lower surface resistivity values. Using a masterbatch dilution technique for the preparation of PP based nanocomposites, Mi\u010du\u0161\u00edk et\u00a0al. [bib17] found better state of CNT dispersion and lower percolation thresholds when using a high melt flow PP type for the dilution step. The influence of molecular weight of polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on the percolation threshold of composites prepared using a latex approach was investigated by Hermant et\u00a0al. [bib18]. A shift in the percolation threshold from 0.9 to 0.6\u00a0wt.% was observed for PS matrix material, whereas for PMMA the percolation threshold shifted from 0.6 to 0.3\u00a0wt.% upon increasing the amount of low molecular weight polymer in the polymer matrix. Two recently published studies discussed the effect of PCs with different molecular weight [bib19 bib20]. Better MWCNT agglomerate dispersion was observed when using higher viscosity PC [bib20]. When using the same mixing conditions at a given CNT content of 1\u00a0wt.%, lower viscosity PC composites showed higher conductivity values.", "The dispersion mechanism of primary MWCNT agglomerates in a PC matrix was discussed in a paper by Kasaliwal et\u00a0al. [bib21] by varying the mixing energy input trough variation of mixing speed and mixing time. The kinetic study of the remaining agglomerate area revealed that both, rupture and erosion processes take place. With increasing mixing speed, a dominance of rupture mechanism was observed.", "The electrical resistivity of a polymer-CNT composite is not only affected by the dispersion obtained after the incorporation step of the CNTs. In addition, a secondary agglomeration phenomenon, leading to lower resistivity values, takes place when the sample is heated above the glass transition temperature [bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26]. This phenomenon is more pronounced at lower melt viscosity during the annealing step. In accordance with this, Pegel et\u00a0al. [bib26] reported lower resistivity values for PC samples (with the same molecular weight) compression moulded under otherwise constant conditions at 300\u00a0\u00b0C as compared to 250\u00a0\u00b0C.", "Besides the state of nanotube dispersion, the electrical percolation threshold is also influenced by the aspect ratio (<i>\u03bb</i>\u00a0=\u00a0<i>L</i>/<i>D</i>) of the nanotubes with an indirect linear relation between the percolation concentration and \u03bb [bib27 bib28 bib29]. Considering the particle length distribution of the CNTs, a simulation by Kyrylyuk et\u00a0al. revealed that the system is very sensitive to small quantities of longer CNTs leading to lower percolation thresholds [bib29]. Thus, in order to estimate the percolation threshold, the knowledge of the aspect ratio (or its distribution) is needed. While the distribution of nanotubes diameters D can be relatively easy assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the determination of distributions of the nanotube lengths L is more difficult. Recently, Krause et\u00a0al. [bib30] described a method to disperse as-grown CNTs and CNTs dissolved from composites using a suitable solvent and gentle ultrasonic treatment. Using image analysis on TEM images the nanotubes length distributions were measured illustrating severe shortening after melt processing.", "In this study, general tendencies of the influence of melt viscosity on the dispersion and electrical properties of MWCNT-polymer composites in different classes of thermoplastic polymers (polar, non polar, amorphous or crystalline) are investigated. Therefore, five different polymers types, namely polyamide 12 (PA12), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polycarbonate (PC), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) with three different melt viscosity levels (low, medium and high viscosity) were melt mixed with MWCNTs and the morphology as well as the electrical properties were studied."]], ["Experimental", [["Materials", ["MWCNTs used were commercially available Baytubes\u00ae C150P (Bayer MaterialScience AG, Leverkusen, Germany) with a carbon purity of >95%, a bulk density of 120\u2013170\u00a0kg/m3 \n                        [bib31], an mean diameter of 10.5\u00a0nm [bib32], and agglomerate sizes of 30\u2013550\u00a0\u03bcm [bib33].", "For polymer, polyamide 12 (PA12, with an excess of acid end groups), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polycarbonate (PC), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), low density polyethylene (LDPE) were used.

In agreement with the other types of examined polymers, the state of nanodispersion is much better in the high viscosity LDPE matrix even if in both cases relative densely packed agglomerates can be seen representing undispersed primary agglomerates. In the low viscosity LDPE these agglomerates are up to 1\u00a0\u03bcm and only some dispersed MWCNTs were obtained, whereas in the high viscosity LDPE only some much smaller agglomerates are seen.", "In summary, in accordance with the investigations on the macrodispersion using LM also on the nanolevel assessed using TEM better dispersion is seen in the composites based on high viscosity matrices. However, the composites based on low viscosity matrices also show isolated nanotubes between the observed primary and secondary agglomerates but on lesser extent."]], ["MWCNT length distribution before and after processing", ["It has been long assumed and was recently shown and quantified by Krause et\u00a0al. [bib30 bib35] that melt processing of CNT-polymer composites can lead to significant nanotube shortening, which influences the properties of the composites. In the present study, the influence of matrix viscosity on the degree of MWCNT shortening was quantified using the example of polycarbonate. The MWCNT length distribution of the as-grown Baytubes\u00ae C150P is shown in [fig6]\n                         as reported by Castillo et\u00a0al. [bib32]. The composites based on the low and the high viscosity polycarbonate containing 0.75\u00a0wt.% MWCNTs were dissolved. Nanotubes were recovered and observed using TEM and their length distribution alongside with typical length values are shown also in [fig6]. Both distributions are shifted to smaller nanotube length and are narrowed. Considering the x50-values (770\u00a0nm for as received Baytubes\u00ae C150P, 418\u00a0nm after processing with low viscosity PC, 350\u00a0nm after processing with high viscosity PC), a significant MWCNT length shortening during the melt mixing was found for both composites. Using the low viscosity matrix, the nanotubes retained 54% of their initial length whereas after mixing with the high viscosity matrix, only 45% was retained. These values correspond to mixing energy inputs of 4625\u00a0J/cm3 for the low viscosity matrix and 9425\u00a0J/cm3 for the high viscosity matrix, respectively. Also the x10-value decreased after processing indicating that more very short nanotubes were generated. The most severe change was observed concerning the x90-values which illustrate a much smaller number of long nanotubes after melt mixing with the high viscosity matrix. The x90-values decreased from 2407\u00a0nm to 935\u00a0nm (to 39%) for the CNTs dissolved from the composites based on the low viscosity PC and for the CNTs dissolved from the high viscosity PC to 570\u00a0nm (to 23%) illustrating the much higher degree of shortening when using a higher viscosity matrix."]]]], ["Discussion", ["The most effective dispersion and distribution of primary MWCNT agglomerates was obtained when using high viscosity matrices albeit this also resulted in increased nanotube shortening as compared to the use of lower viscosity matrices. In contrast to that, all composites with high viscosity matrices resulted in higher electrical percolation thresholds, which are expected to be lower at good macroscale dispersion. Thus, counteracting effects of matrix viscosity have to be considered during the melt mixing procedure and the agglomerate dispersion as well as during the CNT network formation responsible for percolation. The effects of matrix viscosity on the infiltration of polymer chains into the primary agglomerates, the shear forces generated during mixing and the secondary agglomeration process will be discussed. These effects in context with nanotube length shortening will be considered to explain the observed electrical percolation concentrations.", "Within the dispersion process of primary nanotube agglomerates, the infiltration process of matrix polymer chains into the pores of the agglomerates is the first step [bib20]. The infiltration is much faster and, depending on the size of the agglomerates, more complete in case of low molecular matrices.", "On the other hand, lower viscosity matrices produce under otherwise constant mixing conditions lower shear stresses during mixing and result in lower mixing energy inputs as compared to high viscosity matrices. In [fig7]\n                      the agglomerate area ratio in relation to the input of mixing energy is shown. Using a high viscosity matrix leads to higher shear stresses and torque values measured during the compounding. Therefore higher mixing energy inputs are observed as compared to the use of lower viscosity matrices. In case of PA12 and PBT, this rise in mixing energy, when applying three different viscosity matrices, leads to a decrease in the area ratio of undispersed primary CNT agglomerates A/A0. For PC and PEEK, the energy inputs for the low viscosity\u00a0matrices were already sufficient to achieve a nearly perfect dispersion of the primary agglomerates, so that no influence of the mixing energy could be observed within the experiments. If only the area ratio A/A0 is considered, no changes in the state of CNT agglomerate macrodispersion were obtained when using the three different viscosity levels leading to varying mixing energy inputs in the LDPE composites.", "The finding of lowering the area ratio A/A0 with energy input is in good agreement with Kasaliwal et\u00a0al. [bib20] who found better dispersion of Baytubes\u00ae C150HP when using higher mixing speed resulting in higher shear stresses.", "The nanodispersion observed by TEM showed well dispersed and homogenously distributed nanotubes in nearly all examined composites based on high viscosity matrices, except for composites based on high viscosity LDPE in which case some remaining agglomerates were found. In contrast, in all composites based on low viscosity matrices, a certain extent of nanoagglomeration was found, mainly addressed as secondary agglomerates formed during compression moulding. Such nanoagglomeration is more pronounced if the viscosity of the matrix is lower as the mobility of the nanotubes is then higher.", "For electrical percolation of nanotubes within an isolating matrix, the formation of a conductive network is needed. Its formation is assumed to be facilitated if the nanotubes are not restricted in remaining primary agglomerates and are nicely dispersed. However, a conductive network can also be established between agglomerates connected by separated tubes or in slightly agglomerated structures [bib36] as formed by secondary agglomeration [bib22 bib26]. The finding for all polymer types that lower percolation thresholds were found at lower matrix viscosity despite worse dispersion as compared to higher matrix viscosity, may be mainly explained by such conductive network structures. On the one hand, remaining primary agglomerates are connected by some dispersed tubes yet on the other hand, secondary agglomerates enhance the formation of networks. At the corresponding nanotube concentrations, the nanotubes seem to be too well separated in the corresponding high viscosity matrices. In addition, an effect of the nanotube length, more shortened when using high viscosity matrices, can be expected.", "As discussed extensively in literature, the electrical percolation threshold directly depends on the aspect ratio of the fillers. Thus, a variation of the carbon nanotube length during processing can lead to a shift of the percolation threshold.

For this case the theoretical percolation thresholds for composites based on low viscosity PC were calculated to be 1.8\u00a0wt.% (experimental: 0.5\u20130.75\u00a0wt.%) and 2.2\u00a0wt.% (experimental: \u223c1\u00a0wt.%) for the high viscosity matrix. As especially long MWCNTs contribute to the formation of the conductive network [bib29], the calculation was also carried out with x90-values for the CNT length. Using these values, theoretical percolation thresholds of 0.9\u00a0wt.% for the low viscosity and 1.4\u00a0wt.% for the high viscosity PC matrix were calculated. These estimations show, that the more pronounced shortening of nanotube length in the high viscosity PC due to the higher mixing energy input can partially explain the differences in the electrical percolation threshold between composites based on different viscosity levels. Even if not investigated, similar trends for the nanotubes length distributions are expected also for the other types of polymers."]], ["Summary", ["MWCNT composites were prepared by melt mixing of five different polymer types in three different viscosity grades with Baytubes\u00ae C150P. A significant impact of the melt viscosity of the matrix on the electrical properties of the composites was found for all investigated polymers (PA12, PBT, PEEK, PC and LDPE). The lowest electrical percolation threshold was always found in the composites based on the low viscosity matrix. This finding could not be explained by the state of macrodispersion of the primary MWCNT agglomerates observed via light microscopy, which was in most cases better when using high viscosity matrices. As the mixing energy input increases with higher melt viscosity of the matrix, an improved state of macrodispersion was observed at higher melt viscosities (for PA12, PBT and PC). In PEEK composites, the macrodispersion was already nearly perfect in the low viscosity matrix; therefore no further enhancement could be achieved using higher viscosity matrices. The worst state of macrodispersion was found for LDPE composites, showing that obviously higher mixing energy inputs than used in this study were needed to achieve suitable MWCNT dispersion. When higher melt viscosity grades of LDPE were processed, a change in MWCNT agglomerate size distribution towards a higher number of small particles was observed. TEM images revealed loosely packed nanoagglomerates mainly in the low viscosity matrices. This clustered substructure obviously helped to lower the electrical resistivity values of the composites and resulted in the lower percolation thresholds as compared to high viscosity matrices where the nanotubes were found to be strongly separated. In addition, different degrees of nanotube shortening during processing were found when using matrices with varying viscosities. In the case of PC, a shortening to 54% was found when using a low viscosity matrix, but to 45% for the high viscosity matrix (considering x50-values). The x90-values of the nanotube length distribution illustrating the part of long CNTs decreased to 39% for low viscosity PC and to 23% of their initial size for high viscosity material. As the aspect ratio is directly linked to the composite percolation threshold, the differences in the experimental finding of lower thresholds at higher matrix viscosity can be partially also explained by the length shortening."]]], "doi": "10.1016/j.polymer.2011.12.019"}
