"]], ["Introduction", ["The addition of nanoparticles (NPs) to a polymer matrix is hypothesized to significantly alter the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the host polymer due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of NPs. To properly tune the desired properties of these polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), a fundamental understanding of polymer\u2013NP interactions and their effect on polymer dynamics is essential. Simulations have predicted that polymer\u2013NP interactions (whether attractive or repulsive) can greatly influence the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PNCs.(1, 2) Also, several experiments have demonstrated that strong, attractive polymer\u2013NP interactions (a case in which simulations are currently limited due to significant slowing down of polymer dynamics) can significantly increase the Tg of PNCs.(3-5) It has been postulated that the polymer near the NPs adsorbs to the surface, essentially immobilizing the polymer at the interface and ultimately leading to formation of the so-called \u201cdead layer\u201d.(6, 7) However, the formation of this \u201cdead layer\u201d still lacks an explanation for significant changes in Tg at relatively low NP loading as the dynamics of the polymer in between the NPs would have to be greatly affected on length scales comparable to interparticle spacing (greater than 100 nm).(8) Unfortunately, the progress in understanding how nanoparticle\u2013polymer interactions affect glass transition phenomenon in PNCs is rather slow due to numerous quantitative and qualitative discrepancies in the reports of Tg shifts in PNCs measured by different experimental techniques,(3-5, 8-17) as described in the work of Robertson and Roland.(18) Thus, it remains an open question as to how the addition of nanoparticles affects the dynamics of the polymer melt. The polymer near the surface of an attractive NP is expected to exhibit significantly different chain and segmental dynamics due to steric hindrance and polymer/nanoparticle interactions. Many attempts have been made to characterize the extent of the interfacial polymer layer, with estimates varying from 1 to 10 nm for spherical nanofillers.(11-17) However, most of these estimates are dependent upon the assumption that the interfacial polymer is a \u201cdead layer\u201d, i.e., completely immobilized with respect to the remaining polymer. Recent studies investigating the local dynamics of the polymer chains in the interfacial region via neutron scattering, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and simulations have determined that the dynamics are in fact not immobilized.(19-22) Instead, these studies demonstrated that a wide distribution of segmental relaxation rates exist in these interfacial regions. By controlling the chemistry of nanoparticles it should be possible to carefully tune the distribution of relaxation times in a polymer around the nanoparticle, and at high loading of NPs it should be possible to transform the neat polymer into an almost entirely \u201cinterfacial\u201d material with properties different from those of the neat polymer. Therefore, gaining an understanding the dynamics of the interfacial polymer and the role of polymer\u2013NP interaction is of great technological importance. In this article, temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC), broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to investigate the effects of silica NPs on the static and dynamic properties of poly (2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP). We have chosen this PNC as a model attractive polymer/NP system due to the relatively strong hydrogen bonding between the polar P2VP and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica NP. The presence of an interfacial polymer layer is indicated by calorimetric and dielectric techniques as a systematic broadening of the step in heat capacity at Tg and a corresponding apparent broadening of the segmental relaxation process in the BDS spectra. A detailed analysis of the dielectric spectra reveals that this apparent broadening cannot be accounted for by changes in the shape of the segmental relaxation process alone. Instead the changes of the BDS spectra can be accounted for by the emergence of a new, slower relaxation process that corresponds to the interfacial polymer layer. Furthermore, the static structure of the PNCs indicates the existence of a core\u2013shell morphology. The average thickness of the interfacial region was estimated to be approximately 4\u20136 nm from both static (SAXS) and dynamic (BDS) measurements. "]], ["Experimental Details", ["Poly(2-vinylpyridine) (Mw = 97k, Mw/Mn = 1.07, Tg = 368 K) was purchased from Polymer source, Inc. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS,>95%), Ethanol, ammonium aqueous solution (30\u201333 wt %), and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used without further purification. Monodisperse colloidal silica nanoparticles (D = 30 nm) were synthesized by the modified St\u00f6ber method according to the previous reports.(23, 24) Different concentrations of the nanoparticles in a water/ethanol solution were mixed with P2VP in MEK. The mixtures were stirred for 1\u20132 h, transferred into Teflon molds, and then placed into a vacuum oven at room temperature and 1 mbar for 24 h. To remove remaining solvent, temperature was raised to 80 \u00b0C and samples were kept in a vacuum oven for an additional 48 h. The resulting samples are transparent. Thermodynamic gravitational analysis (TGA) with a Q50 (TA Instruments) confirmed the final weight percent of the nanoparticles in all polymer nanocomposites. For TEM measurements the samples were embedded in epoxy, cured overnight, and subsequently microtomed with a Leica Ultra microtome EM UC7 using a diamond knife at ambient conditions with resulting specimens having thicknesses \u223c200 nm. TEM measurements were performed on Zeiss Libra 200 HT FE MC with an operating voltage of 200 kV and an emission current of 230 mA. TMDSC measurements were carried out on a Q2000 (TA Instruments), calibrated by indium and sapphire standards, using standard TZero aluminum pans. The samples were measured twice using the same procedure: ramp to 473 at 10 K/min, isothermal annealing at 473 K for 10 min to erase any thermal history, and then cooled to 293 at 10 K/min with a modulation of \u00b11 K/min. The results from both measurement scans did coincide indicating reproducibility of the results and absence of solvent. BDS measurements were performed using a Novocontrol Alpha analyzer and the sample temperature was controlled by a Quatro Cryosystem with a stability of \u00b10.1 K. Prior to measurements the samples were annealed at 400 K in the dielectric sample chamber and the response was measured as a function of time until the real and imaginary permittivity became constant for any given frequency, which indicated that thermal equilibrium was achieved and the geometric properties of the sample stopped changing. The isothermal frequency scans were performed in the frequency range of 10\u20131\u2013107 Hz at each temperature, in the range 375\u2013473 K. The sample was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min at each of the temperature set point prior to the measurements. The cooling/heating rate between each temperature set point was set to 10 K/min. The samples were measured twice (on cooling and heating) to ensure data reproducibility and all analysis was performed on cooling data. SAXS was performed at room temperature with a Molecular Metrology instrument equipped with a monochromatic X-ray source (Cu K\u03b1, \u03bb = 1.54 \u00c5), a pair of Kirkpatrick\u2013Baez microfocusing mirrors, and a 2-dimensional position sensitive detector. The sample\u2013detector distance was 1.5 m with a q-range of 0.01 to 0.15 \u00c5\u20131. The X-ray operating voltage was 45 kV with a current of 0.66 mA and the exposure time was 1 h for each sample. "]], ["Results and Discussion", ["We first performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements to verify the nanoparticles are (1) monodisperse and (2) uniformly distributed. In Figure 1, TEM images of a highly filled polymer nanocomposite (40 wt % silica) are shown to illustrate the well dispersed silica nanoparticles. The silica nanoparticles are uniformly distributed across the entire sample even at length scales larger than 2 \u03bcm and have an average interparticle spacing of 15 nm, which corresponds well to the estimated interparticle spacing for ideal spherical packing.(25) Figure 2 shows the X-ray scattering profiles of the PNCs. The peak position of q = 0.02 \u00c5\u20131 persists for all NP concentrations and corresponds to a distance of 31.5 nm, the diameter of our NPs. To quantitatively characterize the structure of these nanocomposites, the scattering curves are fit to model scattering functions. The data could not be fit to the scattering of dispersed spheres, indicating that the structure of this nanocomposite cannot be described as spherical nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in a continuous matrix. The scattering data did fit well (Figure 2) to a linear combination of the Beaucage(26, 27) and core\u2013shell models.(28) The core\u2013shell model is chosen to model the silica nanoparticle (core) and the interfacial bound polymer layer (shell), where the inclusion of the Beaucage model allows us to account for any nonuniformity of the density of the shell and the fact that the interface between the shell and the matrix is not sharp. From this analysis, the size of the interfacial polymer (i.e., shell) is found to be approximately 4\u20135 nm for all nanocomposites. The results also show that the interface between the bound layer and matrix is fairly broad, exhibiting a Porod exponent of 3 (a sharp interface has a Porod exponent = 4). These results therefore indicate that the interfacial layer is not uniform, but exhibits a gradient in structure. This suggests that the decrease in segmental mobility near the NP surface presumably changes with the distance from the surface.  Having verified the quality of NP dispersion and structure in our PNCs, we then measured the temperature dependent heat capacity, Cp, of each PNC via TMDSC. Traditional DSC measures the heat flow from a material described by the following relation, (dH)/(dt) = Cp(dT)/(dt) + f(T,t), where dH/dt is the total heat flow, Cp is the heat capacity of the sample, dT/dt is the heating rate, and f(T,t) is the kinetic term. We employ TMDSC in order to separate the reversing heat flow term, Cp dT/dt, and the nonreversing term, f(T,t), and use the reversing heat flow term to accurately determine the heat capacity of the sample while avoiding kinetic effects such as solvent evaporation, crystallization, and enthalpic recovery. From this point on any mention of heat capacity or specific heat capacity will refer to the reversing component. The inset of Figure 3 illustrates the temperature dependent specific heat capacity, cp (cp = Cp/m), in the vicinity of the calorimetric glass transition temperature for the neat polymer and PNCs. The overall specific heat capacity and the magnitude of the glass transition step decreases with increasing NP loading which is due to the lower specific heat capacity of silica. To quantitatively compare the specific heat capacity of the remaining polymer fraction within the PNC, we have removed the NP contribution such that(1)where CPNC and Cfiller are the heat capacities of the PNC and filler, cpfiller is the measured specific heat capacity of silica, mpolymer is the mass of the polymer fraction, and mfiller is the mass fraction of the filler. Using eq 1 and subtracting the NP contributions from the heat capacity curves, the cppolymer curves are then arbitrarily shifted on the y-axis to illustrate the changes in specific heat capacity at the glass transition with increasing NP loading. As is seen in Figure 3, a systematic broadening of the glass transition is observed with increasing NP loading, while the magnitude of the glass transition step, \u0394cp, remains essentially constant and independent of NP concentration. A decrease in \u0394cp with increasing NP loading has been observed for some PNCs and was attributed to the interfacial polymer being essentially immobilized relative to the bulk polymer. However, a decrease in \u0394cp is not observed for the presented P2VP PNCs, and instead the glass transition step is significantly broadened. Since the calorimetric glass transition process broadens without a clear decrease in glass transition strength with increasing NP concentration, this indicates that the interfacial polymer segments are not completely immobilized relative to the bulk in our system, but they are instead slightly suppressed and likely possess a wide distribution of segmental relaxation times. Even though the presence of the interfacial polymer seems to significantly broaden the glass transition step, the Tg of the PNCs changes only slightly, as shown in Table 1.  We employ broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) to better understand the effects of silica NP on the polymer dynamics\u2014specifically the changes in dielectric strength, the segmental relaxation times, and Tg. Figure 4a presents the imaginary part of the complex permittivity of each PNC measured at 400 K. The spectra are normalized with respect to the secondary relaxation process, assuming that it is not affected significantly by NPs.(29) The spectra clearly show a decrease in amplitude and broadening on the low-frequency side of the segmental relaxation peak (Figure 4a). This is especially obvious in the spectrum of the derivative of the real part (Figure 4b) which is less affected by the conductivity contribution at lower frequencies. For neat P2VP, a single Havriliak\u2013Negami (HN) function and conductivity describes the data well (Figure 4c). However, a single HN function is not sufficient to fit the PNC data. So, we fit the imaginary part of the dielectric spectra by two HN functions and a conductivity term:(3)where \u0394\u03b5 is the dielectric strength of the relaxation process, \u03c4HN is the Havriliak\u2013Negami relaxation time, and the exponents \u03b3 and \u03b2 describe the width and asymmetry of the spectra, respectively. In addition, \u03c30 and \u03b50 denote the dc conductivity and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. Figure 4d shows the spectra of the 40 wt % SiO2 PNC, where two HN functions are necessary to accurately fit the data. The fitting of the dielectric spectra of the silica composites was performed as follows. The stretching parameters \u03b3 and \u03b2 for the segmental relaxation process in the composites were taken to be equal to those of neat P2VP and were kept constant during the fit procedure regardless of the NP loading. The stretching parameters for the slow interfacial relaxation process were initialized as being equal to those of the bulk-like relaxation process and were allowed to vary. The \u0394\u03b5\u2019s of the segmental and slow interfacial relaxation processes were initialized according to volume fractions of silica and polymer and then allowed to vary. The characteristic HN relaxation time for the bulk-like relaxation was initialized as that of the neat segmental process, and both \u03c4HN\u2019s were set as free parameters during the fitting procedure. The slower relaxation, referred to as \u03b12, clearly increases in amplitude with an increase in NP concentration. So, we ascribe it to the relaxation of the interfacial polymer at the nanoparticle/polymer interface. The dynamics of the interfacial polymer layer are usually thought to be highly suppressed. However, in the case of our P2VP/silica nanocomposites, we observe the neat polymer segmental dynamics bifurcate into two relaxation peaks, with one peak related to the bulk relaxation of P2VP and the other most likely due to that of the interfacial polymer. Additionally, the sum of \u0394\u03b51 and \u0394\u03b52 for PNCs of all silica concentrations is found to remain constant and equal to the dielectric strength of the alpha relaxation in pure polymer, indicating that the decrease in \u0394\u03b51 is accounted for by an increase in \u0394\u03b52. Thus, we find evidence in the dielectric spectrum for an interfacial polymer region where the segmental mobility is on average slower by \u223c2 orders of magnitude relative to that of the remaining bulk polymer. Since neither \u0394\u03b5Total nor \u0394cp of the polymer decrease with increasing NP concentration, we conclude that there is no \u201cdead layer\u201d of polymer in any of our PNCs but instead a layer of reduced mobility at the polymer\u2013NP interface.  Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the interfacial and bulk polymer relaxation times for the 40 wt % SiO2 PNC as well as the estimated glass transition temperatures from the Vogel\u2013Fulcher\u2013Tammann (VFT) equation, \u03c4\u03b1 = \u03c40 exp(\u2212B/(T \u2013 T0)), where \u03c40, B, and T0 are fitting parameters and Tg is defined as the temperature at which \u03c4\u03b1 = 100s. The interfacial polymer exhibits a relaxation time that is approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower than that of the bulk polymer, a slightly weaker temperature dependence, and a higher estimated Tg from the VFT fit (8 K higher). It is noteworthy that the temperature dependence of the segmental relaxation times of the bulk polymer is essentially unaffected by the presence of NPs. This indicates that the presence of NPs simply slows down the dynamics of polymer segments in the vicinity of the NP\u2019s surface.  We now analyze the \u0394\u03b5 of the bulk and interfacial segmental relaxation processes to determine the fraction of polymer adsorbed at the interfacial region in our PNCs. The estimation of thickness of the interfacial polymer layer within PNCs from BDS is well established and can be found in references 12 and 17. The interfacial layer thickness is computed using a simple volumetric estimate using the following relation: d = RNP[((\u03d5IP)/(\u03d5NP) + 1)1/3 \u22121] where, RNP is the radius of the nanoparticles, \u03d5IP is the volume fraction of interfacial polymer determined as (1 \u2013 \u03d5NP) \u00d7 \u0394\u03b52/\u0394\u03b5Total (assuming that the interfacial layer has the same density as bulk-like polymer) and \u03d5NP is the volume fraction of NPs. Figure 6a reveals the volume fraction of the interfacial polymer increases linearly with silica loading and the bulk-like volume fraction decreases accordingly. One aspect of the interfacial polymer which is particularly interesting is its dependence on interparticle spacing. As discussed previously, as the interparticle spacing approaches the length scale of the interfacial thickness, the dynamics are expected to significantly change. The volume percent of interfacial polymer should nearly reach 100% at 48 vol. % silica (\u223c68 wt %). Therefore, the PNC studied with the highest NP loading is 15 vol. % below the NP loading at which the interparticle spacing becomes comparable to a single interfacial polymer thickness, a condition where one would expect \u0394\u03b51/\u0394\u03b5Total to decrease nonlinearly to zero. However, a similar study by Harton et al.(9) demonstrated that the main bulk-like relaxation for P2VP remains when loaded to 48 vol. % with 14 nm silica NPs, which is well above the percolation threshold (\u223c33 vol. %). It is possible that there was enough bulk-like polymer left in the interstitial space between NPs to give rise to a bulk-like dielectric signal at such high particle loadings. The amount of this bulk-like polymer depends also strongly on aggregation of NPs. The interfacial shell thicknesses are calculated from static and dynamic measurements and plotted as a function of NP loading in Figure 6b. These values are similar to estimates from previous studies of polymer bound to flat and curved surfaces.(9-11, 14, 17) Two results are readily apparent from these data: (1) the length scales obtained from static and dynamic measurements are in good agreement\u2013in contrast to previous studies(12)\u2014and (2) the length scale stays essentially constant with NP loading, i.e., with interparticle spacing. These two observations further validate the presence of the interfacial layer, which should only depend on the number of OH- groups on the surface of the silica NPs and the molecular weight of P2VP.(30) It has been suggested that the thickness of the interfacial layer is similar to the radius of gyration, Rg, of the polymer molecule.(30, 31) In the case of our studies, the thickness of the interfacial layer is only half of Rg (Rg of P2VP with Mw \u223c 97k is \u223c11 nm). It is possible that the thickness of this layer is defined by the characteristic length scale of dynamic heterogeneities usually estimated in the range of several nanometers or by the size of the so-called dynamic bead size.(32-34) The latter is estimated to be \u223c5 nm in polystyrene,(33, 34) a polymer similar to the studied P2VP. Unravelling the dependence of the layer thickness on molecular weight, rigidity of the polymer chain, the curvature of the NP surface, and strength of polymer\u2013NP interaction would help to understand the parameters controlling the layer thickness. The observed existence of the interfacial layer with significantly slower segmental dynamics might provide an explanation to the well-known controversies in studies of PNC using different experimental techniques.(18) The group of Torkelson reported a significant change in Tg (\u0394Tg \u223c 11 K) of P2VP by adding just 0.4 vol.% of SiO2 NPs,(5) while other studies found changes of Tg by only a few kelvin with loadings up to \u223c30 vol.%.(8-10) Torkelson and co-workers did not measure directly segmental dynamics, but instead analyzed the fluorescence of dye molecules that are sensitive to the Tg of the polymer.(4, 5) If the dye molecules are preferentially drawn to the surface of NP instead of being homogeneously distributed in the polymer matrix, then this technique will measure Tg of the interfacial layer even at low NP loading. However, the shift in Tg then should not depend much on the NP concentration above some threshold. This is exactly what has been reported.(5) On the other hand, earlier studies using BDS data focused mostly on the main segmental relaxation times (Figure 4) and thus detected only minor variations in Tg even at higher NPs loading.(8) Thus, this controversy reflects the coexistence of bulk-like polymer and an interfacial layer in the same PNC sample, and different experimental techniques might report the Tg of different parts of the sample. We emphasize that both BDS and DSC directly measure segmental dynamics, but their analysis should include a possibility of the existence of an interfacial layer with dynamics that differ significantly from the dynamics of a pure polymer. Additionally, our results stand in contrast to the Long\u2013Lequeux picture of dynamics in polymer nanocomposites that suggests presence of an immobilized, \u201cdead\u201d polymer layer surrounding the particle surface.(35-39) Instead, results of our dielectric measurements reveal that the segmental relaxation of the polymer in the vicinity of the particle is not immoblized, but is slowed down (by a factor of \u223c100 in our case). The reason for the apparent discrepancy between our results and the Long\u2013Lequeux picture might come from the difference in experimental techniques used to probe dynamics of the composites. Presence of the immobilized polymer fraction at the polymer\u2013particle or polymer\u2013substrate interface was reported based on NMR measurements(38) that have an inherent limitation in the frequency range that can be probed\u2014around 10 kHz on the low-frequency side. Thus, relaxation times slower than \u03c4\u03b1= 1/(2\u03c0 \u00d7 104) \u223c 10\u20135 s are inaccessible to conventional NMR techniques. Utilization of the high frequency tail of the relaxation process in the fits does extend the relaxation time range that can be extracted from NMR measurement possibly by another order of magnitude, i.e., up to \u223c10\u20134 s. Thus, any polymer fraction with segmental dynamics that are slower than 0.1 ms might appear as glassy in NMR measurements. As a result, the interfacial layer measured by NMR would have appeared to be glassy in the case of our system at temperatures significantly above Tg. Already at temperatures below \u223c443 K (\u223cTg + 70 K) the relaxation time in the interfacial layer becomes slower than 0.1 ms (Figure 5). The broadband dielectric measurements on the other hand can probe relaxation times as long 103 s and in extreme cases even 106 s.(40) The broader dynamic range of BDS in comparison to NMR measurements allowed us to observe that polymer segments in the interfacial layer are not completely frozen, but are simply slowed down (Figure 5). However, it should be noted that significant broadening of slow relaxation process does hint at the possibility of a significant mobility and Tg gradient being present in the interfacial polymer layer. "]], ["Conclusion", ["The static and dynamic properties of poly(2-vinylpyridine)/silica nanocomposites are characterized by SAXS, TEM, BDS, and TMDSC. Monodisperse silica nanoparticles (30 nm in diameter) are well dispersed even up to high loadings, as verified by TEM. The static structure of the polymer nanocomposites are shown to consist of core\u2013shell structures with a broad interface, where the core is the spherical nanoparticle and the shell is ascribed to the presence of an interfacial polymer layer. Although there is only a slight change in the calorimetric glass transition temperature, a broadening of the glass transition step from TMDSC and the apparent broadening of segmental relaxation process from BDS is observed with NP loading. Furthermore, the apparent broadening of the BDS relaxation is found to be caused by the emergence of a new, slower (\u223c100 times) relaxation process corresponding to the interfacial polymer. The length scale of this interfacial polymer layer as estimated from BDS and SAXS is 4\u20136 nm regardless of interparticle spacing. One of the interesting results of this study is that the presence of the interfacial polymer has no considerable effect on the bulk-like segmental dynamics or the bulk-like glass transition temperature of the composite sample.
